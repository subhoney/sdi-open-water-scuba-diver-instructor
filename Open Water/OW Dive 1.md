# Open Water, Dive 1

## Purpose

To complete eleven SDI open-water skills in open-water conditions under the supervision of an SDI instructor in pursuit of becoming a certified diver.

## Skills

1. Gear assembly
1. Weight check
1. Weight remove/replace (surface)
1. Tired diver tow
1. Controlled descent on a line
1. Weight remove/replace (depth)
1. Regulator recover/clear
1. Partial mask flood
1. Full mask flood
1. Mask remove/replace
1. Controlled ascent
1. BDC remove/replace (surface)

### Gear Assembly

1. **Importance and Value**: When you're on vacation on a dive boat somewhere beautiful, you may have to set your gear up by yourself.
1. **Objective**: By the end of this skill, you'll know how to set your gear up such that you're a safer diver.
1. **Hand Signal**: N/A
1. **Sequence**: *Walk through skill on student request*
1. **Control Flow**: Instructor/DM checks student gear

### Weight Check

1. **Importance and Value**: When you're diving, you may need to re-check your weights for different environment variables (exposure suits, fresh vs. salt, etc.).
1. **Objective**: By the end of this skill, you'll know how to define your own weight requirements.
1. **Hand Signal**: N/A
1. **Sequence**: *Walk through skill on student request*
1. **Control Flow**: Instructor at the front, DM weaving around doing checks

### Weight Removal/Replacement (Surface)

1. **Importance and Value**: You may need to remove a weight pocket at the surface to change the weight you're carrying, or may need to hand it up to a divemaster when returning to the boat.
1. **Objective**: By the end of this skill, you'll be able to remove and replace a weight pocket at the surface.
1. **Hand Signal**: Hand at side, grasp, extend straight out
1. **Sequence**: *Walk through skill on student request*
1. **Control Flow**: Instructor at the front, DM behind or to the side

###  Tired Diver Tow

1. **Importance and Value**: Diving is a physical sport! Tired divers may require help swimming back to a boat or an exit location in certain conditions (heavy surf, after strenuous dives, etc.).
1. **Objective**: By the end of this skill, you'll be able to tow your buddy wearing full SCUBA gear.
1. **Hand Signal**: N/A
1. **Sequence**: *Walk through skill on student request*
1. **Control Flow**: Instructor at dive site, DM shepherding the divers to the buoy.

### Controlled Descent on a Line

1. **Importance and Value**: Descents that are uncontrolled are dangerous. Typically, dive sites will have a descent line; descending that line to the desired start depth in a controlled way is the safest, most comfortable way to start a dive.
1. **Objective**: By the end of this skill, you will be able to descend to a dive's starting depth in a controlled manner.
1. **Hand Signal**: Thumbs down
1. **Sequence**: *Walk through skill on student request*
1. **Control Flow**: Instructor with first group, DM with all subsequent groups
1. **NOTE**: *Remember ORCESD*.

### Weight Removal/Replacement (Depth)

1. **Importance and Value**: Sometimes, weight needs to be adjusted mid-dive, and no one wants to surface to do that! You should be able to pull out a weight pocket and adjust weight at depth.
1. **Objective**: By the end of this skill, you'll be able to remove and replace your weight pockets at depth.
1. **Hand Signal**: Hand at side, grasp, extend straight out.
1. **Sequence**: *Walk through skill on student request*
1. **Control Flow**: Instructor at the front, DM behind or to the side

### Regulator Recovery, Replace, Clear

1. **Importance and Value**: Your regulator is your source of air; you may want to take it out of your mouth from time to time. If it's ever removed from your mouth, you should be able to recover it, replace it and clear it.
1. **Objective**: By the end of this skill, you will be able to recover, replace and clear a lost regulator.
1. **Hand Signal**: Mime regulator removal, recovery, replace
1. **Sequence**: *Walk through skill on student request*
1. **Control Flow**: Instructor at the front, DM behind or to the side
1. **NOTE**: *Remember the bubbles.*

### Partial Mask Flood

1. **Importance and Value**: Sometimes masks leak! Clearing a partially flooded mask is commonplace during any dive.
1. **Objective**: By the end of this skill, you'll be able to clear a partially flooded mask at depth.
1. **Hand Signal**: Mime water halfway filling up mask
1. **Sequence**: *Walk through skill on student request*
1. **Control Flow**: Instructor at the front, DM behind or to the side

### Full Mask Flood

1. **Importance and Value**: You may want to flood your mask fully to clear some fog, or you may just want to cool down with some water on your face!
1. **Objective**: By the end of this skill, you will be able to clear a fully flooded mask at depth.
1. **Hand Signal**: Mime water filling up mask
1. **Sequence**: *Walk through skill on student request*
1. **Control Flow**: Instructor at the front, DM behind or to the side

### Mask Removal and Replacement

1. **Importance and Value**: You may want to take off your mask at some point during a dive. For instance, for a photo, or maybe to swap to a different style or model of a mask.
1. **Objective**: By the end of this skill, you will be able to remove, replace and fully clear your mask at depth.
1. **Hand Signal**: Mime removing and replacing the mask
1. **Sequence**: *Walk through skill on student request*
1. **Control Flow**: Instructor at the front, DM behind or to the side

### Controlled Ascent

1. **Importance and Value**: Uncontrolled ascents cause the majority of diving accidents. It's extremely important that we know how to ascend to the surface in a controlled, methodical way.
1. **Objective**: By the end of this skill, you will be able to surface in a controlled way.
1. **Hand Signal**: Thumbs up
1. **Sequence**: *Walk through skill on student request*
1. **Control Flow**: DM with the first group, instructor last.

### BCD Remove/Replace (Surface)

1. **Importance and Value**: On smaller diving boats, it may be necessary that you remove your BCD at the surface and hand it up to a divemaster to get out of the water. You may also need to make small adjustments to the BCD while on the surface.
1. **Objective**: By the end of this skill, you will be able to remove and replace your BCD at the surface.
1. **Hand Signal**: N/A
1. **Sequence**: *Walk through skill on student request*
1. **Control Flow**: Instructor in the front, DM weaving throughout the students
