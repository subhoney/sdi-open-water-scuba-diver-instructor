# Open Water, Dive 2

## Purpose

To complete seven SDI open-water skills in open-water conditions under the supervision of an SDI instructor in pursuit of becoming a certified diver.

## Skills

1. Giant stride
1. Snorkel/regulator exchange
1. Controlled descent on a line
1. Cramp relief
1. Underwater navigation with kick cycles
1. Alternate air source ascent
1. Controlled ascent
1. Deep water exit

### Giant Stride

1. **Importance and Value**: The most common type of water entry on boats is the giant stride. You can do it off boats, jetties, piers, etc.
1. **Objective**: By the end of this skill, you will know how to giant stride into deep water.
1. **Hand Signal**: N/A
1. **Sequence**: *Walk through skill on student request*
1. **Control Flow**: Divemaster on dock, instructor in water.

### Snorkel/Regulator Exchange

1. **Importance and Value**: While swimming with SCUBA gear on, it's beneficial to be able to use both a snorkel for calm water and your regulator in heavy surf or chop.
1. **Objective**: By the end of this skill, you'll be able to swim in full gear using both a snorkel and a regulator, and will be able to swap between them.
1. **Hand Signal**: N/A
1. **Sequence**: *Walk through skill on student request*
1. **Control Flow**: Instructor at the buoy, DM bringing up the rear.

### Cramp Relief

1. **Importance and Value**: As with any physical activity, cramps are possible, particularly in muscles that aren't used often. Swimming (in general, and finning in particular) can induce cramps in your legs.
1. **Objective**: By the end of this skill, you'll be able to relieve cramps in your legs at depth.
1. **Hand Signal**: Pulsing-fist
1. **Sequence**: *Walk through skill on student request*
1. **Control Flow**: Instructor in the front, DM in the rear.

### Underwater Navigation with Kick Cycles

1. **Importance and Value**: When diving in unfamiliar waters, the easiest way to get where you want to go is to use a compass to navigate and kick cycles to guide.
1. **Objective**: By the end of this skill, you'll be able to navigate by compass and estimate distance using kick cycles.
1. **Hand Signal**: Hand-spinning with index finger outstretched
1. **Sequence**: *Walk through skill on student request*
1. **Control Flow**: Instructor with the navigating students, DM supporting the pack.

### Alternate Air Source Ascent

1. **Importance and Value**: If the worst happens -- an equipment malfunction or an out-of-air emergency -- all divers have a responsibility to know how to share air with a buddy and get them to the surface.
1. **Objective**: By the end of this skill, you'll be able to 
1. **Hand Signal**: Palm of hand bouncing on forehead
1. **Sequence**: *Walk through skill on student request*
1. **Control Flow**: Instructor with each surfacing group, DM supporting the pack. Bounce dive for the instructor.
1. **NOTE**: *Remember the on-surface BCD oral inflation.*

### Deep Water Exit

1. **Importance and Value**: The most common type of water exit in boat diving is the deep water exit. You should be able to climb a ladder and get out of the water onto a boat or a dock safely and comfortably.
1. **Objective**: By the end of this skill, you'll be able to exit deep water using a ladder.
1. **Hand Signal**: N/A
1. **Sequence**: *Walk through skill on student request*
1. **Control Flow**: Instructor in water, DM on dock.
