Thank you for purchasing the SDI / TDI / ERDI Digital Instructor Resources!

We have recently changed how we distribute these documents. Burning, printing and packaging CDs is expensive and environmentally wasteful.  
In an effort to do our share environmentally as well as efficiently, we will now deliver electronic instructor materials on USB thumb drives.  
Not only is the process less wasteful, you now have a reusable drive you can load multiple resources on.  
Be sure to check out the other specialties you currently have a rating for and get your latest digital resource for it – STAY CURRENT!

What you will find on this USB:
- Powerpoint presentations (if available)
- Exams/Knowledge Quests and answer keys
- Digital Version of the Instructor Guide

These items are located in named folders and saved as PDF for your convenience.  Collect them all!!!

We hope you enjoy this new method of delivery!  Please let us know your thoughts at http://www.tdisdi.com/contact
