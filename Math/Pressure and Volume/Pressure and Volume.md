# Pressure and Volume

Informational Requirements:

1. Starting pressure
1. Ending pressure
1. Starting volume
1. Ending volume

## Generalized Boyle's Law

$$
(P_1)(V_1)=(P_2)(V_2)
$$

*Note*: This law applies to both metric and imperial measurements.

## Algebra

This formula can be algebreically manipulated to find the ending pressure or volume: 

$$
P_2=\frac{(P_1)(V_1)}{V_2}
$$

$$
V_2=\frac{(P_1)(V_1)}{P_2}
$$

## Metric Example

> If the volume of gas in a flexible container at 2.5 bar is 12 litres, what will its volume be at 4.6 bar?

$$
(2.5bar)(12L) = (4.6bar)(6.52L)
$$

The volume of the container will be 6.52L at 4.6 bar.

## Imperial Example

> If the volume of gas in a flexible container at 5.8 atm is 3.1 cubic feet, what will its volume be at 2.3 atm?

$$
(5.8atm)(3.1ft^3)=(2.3atm)(7.82ft^3)
$$

The volume of the container will be 7.82ft^3 at 2.3atm.
