# Pressure and Volume

Informational Requirements:

1. Starting pressure
1. Ending pressure
1. Starting volume
1. Ending volume

## Generalized Boyle's Law

$$
(P_1)(V_1)=(P_2)(V_2)
$$

*Note*: This law applies to both metric and imperial measurements.

### Algebra

This formula can be algebreically manipulated to find the ending pressure or volume: 

$$
P_2=\frac{(P_1)(V_1)}{V_2}
$$

$$
V_2=\frac{(P_1)(V_1)}{P_2}
$$

### Examples

> If the volume of gas in a flexible container at 2.5 bar is 12 litres, what will its volume be at 4.6 bar?

$$
(2.5bar)(12L) = (4.6bar)(6.52L)
$$

The volume of the container will be 6.52L at 4.6 bar.

> If the volume of gas in a flexible container at 5.8 atm is 3.1 cubic feet, what will its volume be at 2.3 atm?

$$
(5.8atm)(3.1ft^3)=(2.3atm)(7.82ft^3)
$$

The volume of the container will be 7.82ft^3 at 2.3atm.

## Air Consumption

### Generalized Formula

$$
min_2 = \frac{(P_1)(min_1)}{P_2}
$$

### Examples

> If a supply of gas lasts for 60 minutes at 2 bar or 2 atm, how long will the same supply last at 5 bar or 5 atm?

$$
\frac{(2atm)(60min)}{5atm}=24min
$$

> If a supply of gas lasts for 17 minutes at 5 bar or 5 atm, at what pressure will it last for 30 minutes?

$$
\frac{(5atm)(17min)}{30min}=2.8atm
$$

## Relative Change

### Generalized Formula

$$
change_r=\frac{P_2}{P_1}
$$

### Examples

> What is the relative change in ambient pressure when an object is taken from a starting pressure of 2.5 bar or 2.5 atm to a new pressure of 3.5 bar or 3.5 atm?

$$
\frac{2.5atm}{3.5atm}=1.4atm
$$

> What is the relative change in ambient pressure when an object is taken from a starting pressure of 4.8 bar or 4.8 atm to a new pressure of 2.2 bar or 2.2 atm?

$$
\frac{2.2atm}{4.8atm}=0.46atm
$$
