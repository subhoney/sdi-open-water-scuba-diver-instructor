# Buoyancy Calculations (Imperial)

## Buoyancy

Informational Requirements:

1. Object weight
1. Volume of water displaced by the object
1. Weight of displaced water

$$
Buoyancy = weightOfObject- [(cubicFeetDisplaced)(lbsPerCubicFootOfWater)]
$$

> What is the buoyancy of an object in seawater object that weighs 55 pounds and displaces 0.75 cubic feet?
> 
> $
> 55lbs > [0.75ft^3 x 64lbs] = 7lbs
> $
> 
> The object is 7lbs negatively buoyant.

> What is the buoyancy of an object in freshwater that weighs 40 pounds and displaces 0.75 cubic feet?
> 
> $
> 40lbs > [0.75ft^3 x 62.4lbs] = -6.8lbs
> $
> 
> The object is 6.8lbs positively buoyant.

## Lift Gas Required

To calculate the gas required to lift an object:

$$
litersRequired = |[buoyancyInKg] / [lbs/lbsPercubicFootOfWater]|
$$

A better way to think about this may be to just ditch the absolute value and:

$$
ft^3required= |[negativeBuoyancyInKg] / [kg/literOfWater]|
$$

> How much air must be added to an attached lift to achieve neutral buoyancy for an object that is 10 pounds > negatively buoyant in seawater?
>
> 10lbs / 64lbsPerCubicFoot = 0.156ft^3 air
>
> The object will take 0.156ft^3 of air to lift.
