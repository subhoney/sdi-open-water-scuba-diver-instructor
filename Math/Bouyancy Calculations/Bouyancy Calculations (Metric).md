# Buoyancy Calculations (Metric)

## Buoyancy

Informational Requirements:

1. Object weight
1. Volume of water displaced by the object
1. Weight of displaced water

$$
Buoyancy = weightOfObject- [(litersDisplaced)(kg/literOfWater)]
$$

> What is the buoyancy of an object in seawater that weighs 20 kilograms and displaces 15 liters?
>
> $$
> 20kg - (15)(1.03) = -4.55kg
> $$
>
> The object is negative 4.55kg buoyant.

> What is the buoyancy of an object in freshwater that weighs 10kg and displaces 15L?
>
> $$
> 10kg - (15L*1.0) = 5kg
> $$
>
> The object is 5kg positively buoyant.

## Lift Gas Required

To calculate the gas required to lift an object:

$$
litersRequired = |[buoyancyInKg] / [kg/literOfWater]|
$$

A better way to think about this may be to just ditch the absolute value and:

$$
litersRequired = |[negativeBuoyancyInKg] / [kg/literOfWater]|
$$

> How much air must be added to an attached lift bag to achieve neutral buoyancy for an object that is 4 kg negatively buoyant in seawater?
>
> $$
> \frac{4kg}{1.03kg/L} = 3.88L
> $$
>
> The object would require 3.88L of air to lift.
