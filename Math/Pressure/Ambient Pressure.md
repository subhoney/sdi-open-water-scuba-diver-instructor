# Ambient Pressure

These formulae are general-purpose, and used for seawater. In freshwater, a constant (1.03) must be applied.

P = pressure
D = Depth
msw = meters of seawater
mfw = meters of fresh water
fsw = feet of seawater
ffw = feet of fresh water

## Seawater

> Metric
>
> $
> P = \frac{D}{10}+1
> P = \frac{D+10}{10}
> $

> Imperial
>
> $
> P = \frac{D}{33}+1
> P = \frac{D+33}{33}
> $

### Examples

> What is the ambient pressure at a depth of 14 meters in seawater?
>
> $
> P = \frac{14meters}{10meters/bar}+1 = 2.4 bar
> $

> What is the ambient pressure at a depth of 46 feet in seawater?
>
> $
> P = \frac{46ft}{33ft/atmosphere}+1 = 2.39atm
> $

*Note*: The "+ 1" at the end of the formulae is for the ambient atmosphere. Remember, at sea level, you're at 1 atmosphere, not 0 atmosphere.

## Freshwater

> Metric
>
> $
> P = \frac{D}{10.3}+1
> P = \frac{D+10.3}{10.3}
> $

> Imperial
>
> $
> P = \frac{D}{34}+1
> P = \frac{D+34}{34}
> $

### Examples

> In freshwater, when the diver's depth gauge displays a depth of 20 metres, what will be that diver's true depth?
>
> $
> Depth = (20)(1.03) = 20.6m
> $
>
> The diver's true depth is 20.6 meters in freshwater.

> In freshwater, when the diver's depth gauge displays a depth of 60 feet, what will be that diver's true depth?
>
> $
> Depth = (60ft) x 1.03 = 61.8ft
> $
>
> The diver's true depth is 61.8ft

> When a diver is at a true depth of 20 meters in freshwater, what depth will be displayed by his or her  depth gauge?
>
> GaugeDepth = (20meters) / 1.03 = 19.4meters
>
> The diver's gage will read 19.4 meters.

> When a diver is at a true depth of 60 feet in freshwater, what depth will be displayed by his or her depth gauge?
>
> GaugeDepth = (60feet) / 1.03 = 58.25feet 
>
> The diver's gauge will read 58.25 feet. It will likely be rounded to 58 feet.
