# SDI Open Water Scuba Diver Instructor

## The SDI Open Water Scuba Diver Instructor: Part 1

### Introduction

The next several chapters cover a good deal of valuable background information for the OWSDI candidate including: an overview of International Training's history and philosophy; requirements for certification as an SDI OWSDI and the SDI Member's responsibilities after certification; International Training's quality assurance procedures; and finally, a description of the SDI Standards and Procedures manual and what information it contains. Having a clear understanding of these things will help the candidate understand what is expected of a well-rounded SDI Dive Professional, and in turn, what the dive professional can expect of ITI; this will help establish and promote a long and healthy business relationship.

### The History of ITI

From its humble beginning in 1994 to today, the group of training agencies Scuba Diving International (SDI), Technical Diving International (TDI), and Emergency Response Diving International (ERDI) form one of the largest diving certification agencies in the World International Training Inc (ITI). With 26 regional offices servicing more than 100 countries, the company today far exceeds the original vision the founders had when they conceived the idea on a napkin, sitting at a kitchen table in the early 1990s.

As with many companies, the original concept for the business was an outgrowth of the recognition that a niche needed to be filled. This niche was providing specialized training for what the industry now calls technical diving, and the founders did so by forming the first agency of the group, Technical Diving International, in 1994.

ITI is headquartered in Stuart, Florida, United States, with regional and local offices located in more than 28 locations around the world.

#### Technical Diving International

Technical Diving International was one of the first agencies of its kind. It’s focus was and still is on providing training materials and education for specialized diving situations ranging from Nitrox to closed circuit rebreathers, as well as for overhead environments such as caves and wrecks. TDI also provides training in the preparation of gas mixtures for dives up to 100 meters (330 feet).

During TDI’s development, there were a few key factors that separated it from its competitors and pioneered the way many people learn to dive today. For one, TDI was at the forefront of the movement that convinced the dive industry to accept technical diving activities.

In the early stages of technical diving there were many industry professionals who felt the average diver was not smart enough to handle the expanded dive planning that goes into doing a technical dive, and that technical diving was far too risky for non-professionals. These two factors were offset at TDI by an extensive education process conducted through seminars, publications, and TDI’s training materials. The average diver realized that the risk in technical diving could be brought to an acceptable level and they were indeed smart enough to conduct technical dives.

Today, the industry not only embraces technical diving, but nitrox is now the most popular specialty course taken worldwide. Another key event in TDI’s history occurred when it pioneered the use of semi closed circuit rebreathers (SCR) by recreational divers. This opened the door to allow divers to use closed circuit rebreathers (CCR) recreationally and spawned a whole new segment of the dive industry. In short, TDI ushered in an exciting breakthrough in the dive industry that many believe actually prevented the industry from further decline.

#### Scuba Diving International

In 1998 the membership of TDI could no longer be held back from the demand to create a sport diving division of TDI and thus was born Scuba Diving International (SDI). The primary reason for this expansion was that dive instructors valued dealing with an agency that listened to the instructors in the field and created programs that were, and continue to be, very profitable because they are tailored to the way today's diver wants to learn to dive.

Like TDI, SDI did a number of things that separated it from previously established training agencies. One example is that SDI was the first agency to require the use of 'Personal Dive Computers' (PDC) by all students during all phases of training. This new standard was put in place because PDCs were and are used daily by most divers to make diving safer, more enjoyable and less intimidating. Research showed that the average diver forgot how to use dive tables soon after completion of a course. This fact along with the advancement and increased reliability of dive computers meant they were considered a better alternative to dive tables. SDI recognized this and although dive tables are not required curriculum in the basic diver course, they still can be taught during any course.

Another groundbreaking step taken by SDI was the development of an e-learning platform for dive education. The idea of allowing a student to learn the academic portion of a dive course online rather than requiring additional classroom instruction was a bold yet visionary step. Currently SDI is one of only a few agencies that offer divers the opportunity to learn online.

#### Emergency Response Diving International

With the membership now happy about their options for both sport and technical dive training through SDI and TDI, they continued to ask for more specialized training in public safety diving, and thus Emergency Response Diving International (ERDI) was born in 2000. ERDI was and continues to be the only training program that is supported by a major certification agency catering exclusively to public safety diving. Throughout the years ERDI has written programs that have trained very established dive teams such as the Chicago Fire Department, numerous state police dive teams, and several federal agencies.

#### Recreational Scuba Training Council and World Recreational Scuba Training Council

In 2004, with 10 years of development into the company, the founders of SDI/TDI/ERDI decided it was time to move on and sold the company to a group of investors who quickly expanded the offerings of the company. Immediate changes included applying for and receiving acceptance into the Recreational Scuba Training Council (RSTC) and the European Underwater Federation (EUF). This acceptance was critical because it meant that SDI standards were evaluated and found to be sound and safe by its competitors. SDI passed with ease and today is actively involved in both organizations, helping maintain diver safety. Other changes came with additional staff and a commitment to embrace electronic technologies to make doing business easier for members

Although SDI/TDI/ERDI is considered to be one of the newer organizations in the industry, it is viewed as one of the most professional and progressive certification agencies. ITI’s history and its reputation as an innovator have built a strong foundation for the future. By listening to its members, building programs that are profitable and addressing scuba diving’s inherent risks in a positive way, the future is bright for the organization.

### SDI Requirements for OWSDI Certification

The SDI Open Water Scuba Diver Instructor (OWSDI) program is the next step in a professional diving career. Upon successful completion of this program, the OWSDI will be able to introduce students to the underwater world for the first time and teach all of the SDI core programs. These core programs start with the open water scuba diver and progress through the assistant instructor level. Teaching these new levels will bring more responsibility and new challenges.

The OWSDI is comprised of two parts, the Instructor Development Course (IDC) and the Instructor Evaluation Course (IEC)In order to meet the responsibilities and challenges of the IDC/IEC, it’s vital that the OWSDI candidate be prepared to begin the training process. To help ensure the candidate is prepared, an established set of prerequisites must be met to start the program. The prerequisites include:

Upon successful completion of the Open Water Scuba Diver Instructor course, the OWSDI is qualified to conduct the following: Teach all SDI core levels from Open Water Scuba Diver through Assistant Instructor, where allowed.

- Teach the SDI Computer Diver Specialty
- Teach the Advanced Adventure Specialty
- Teach approved specialties after receiving training in those specialties.

As described above, the SDI Open Water Scuba Diver Instructor must have achieved certain requirements before starting and met the final guidelines, in order to complete the OWSDI course. Once certified, the OWSDI will need to meet and maintain an established set of guidelines in order to remain an active SDI Instructors. Should an SDI member fail to meet the established guidelines for active teaching status, their status may be adjusted accordingly as defined in the following section.

### Membership Status

The status of a SDI Dive Leader, along with their qualifications, defines what they are able to do and to whom they are allowed to teach and issue certifications. SDI has established specific guidelines that must be adhered to in order for an SDI OWSDI to become and remain active status.

If a dive leader fails to meet the minimum guidelines, they will be placed on a different status, which may limit or prevent some or all of their abilities as an SDI Dive Leader until the situation is rectified.

The definition, description and abilities of each member's status within the SDI System are defined below, as well as potential reasons a dive leader would be placed on the associated status.

#### Active Teaching Status

An SDI OWSDI given the designation of active teaching status must adhere to the following criteria: their annual dues and account balances from the previous year must be paid in full, they must submit proof of current liability insurance where required by law, they must have taught or assisted in at least one SDI Open Water Scuba Diver course and have the ability to perform all leadership skills to demonstration quality. Once all criteria have been met, the SDI Open Water Scuba Diver Instructor is authorized to teach SDI courses and certify students for courses in which they are certified to do so as stipulated by the SDI Standards.

#### Probation Status

An SDI OWSDI may be placed on probation status for any of the following reasons: their account balance is older than 90 days, they have failed to meet the contractual obligations of active teaching status or they have violated teaching standards.

An OWSDI placed on probation status is authorized to teach SDI courses and to certify SDI Divers. However, further standards violations may result in an SDI Open Water Scuba Diver Instructor being moved from probation status to suspended or even expelled status.

#### Non-Teaching Status

An SDI OWSDI can be placed on non-teaching status for any of the following reasons: their account balance is older than 90 days, they have been temporarily placed on suspension or they have failed to meet the contractual obligations of active teaching status.

Should the SDI OWSDI be placed in a non-teaching status, they are not authorized to teach SDI courses or to certify SDI divers. Change of the member’s status will be provided in writing to the member from International Training’s HQ Training Department.

#### Suspended Status

An SDI OWSDI can be placed on suspended status for any of the following reasons: their account balance is older than 120 days and the SDI OWSDI has made no attempt to rectify the situation, they have failed to meet the contractual obligations of active teaching status or they have violated training standards.

An SDI OWSDI placed on suspended status is not authorized to teach SDI courses or to certify SDI divers. Further standards violations can result in an SDI Open Water Scuba Diver Instructor being moved from suspended status to expelled status. Prior to being placed in a suspended status the SDI Open Water Scuba Diver Instructor will be notified in writing

#### Expelled Status

An SDI OWSDI can be placed on expelled status for any of the following reasons: their account balance is older than 120 days and the SDI OWSDI has made no attempt to rectify the situation, they have been placed on Suspended or Probation Status on more than one occasion, they have failed to meet the contractual obligations of active teaching status, or they have violated teaching standards and have displayed conduct unbecoming a professional SDI OWSDI.

An SDI OWSDI placed on expelled status is no longer authorized to teach SDI courses or certify SDI divers. An SDI OWSDI who has been expelled is no longer considered a member of SDI.

*NOTE*: ITI reserves the right to suspend, expel or terminate the membership of any member based upon the determination that standards violations have occurred by the individual.

It is in the best interest of all parties that dive leaders remain on active status throughout their career; however, there are specific issues that arise from time to time. Should such a situation arise, the dive professional is encouraged to immediately contact SDI’s Training department so they may help solve the issue in the most efficient way possible. Remember, SDI is there to help the SDI Instructor be successful.

### Annual Dive Professional Renewal

As described in the previous section, SDI/TDI/ERDI Dive Professionals must renew their membership every year to remain active and able to conduct programs they are qualified to teach. Regardless of when a dive professional first became a member of SDI/TDI/ERDI they must renew by January 1 of each year. A reduced fee is offered if the dive professional renews prior to December 15.

To renew membership, the dive professional can visit the 'Member Services' area of the SDI/TDI/ERDI website and print the renewal form, They must complete the form and send it by fax or mail to the ITI Regional Office through which they work. Only one form must be completed and only one fee paid, even if the dive professional is a member of SDI, TDI and ERDI.

There are annual renewal requirements the member must meet to renew as an active dive professional. In addition there are renewal requirements that must be met every two years. If an individual does not meet these requirements they will be required to complete an update with a designated SDI/TDI/ERDI Headquarters Representative.

Once the renewal form is received by SDI/TDI/ERDI Headquarters the dive professional's membership will be processed. A sticker indicating the member's new expiration date will be sent. This sticker must be placed on the member's dive professional card in the appropriate location.

An online option is also available on the member services page of the SDI/TDI/ERDI website. Click on that option and follow the directions. Not only does the online option allow for a more timely renewal process but also it is eco friendly by not requiring the use of paper.

Please remember that, as mentioned before, SDI is there to help the member be successful. The SDI OWSDI should contact them if they have any questions about anything regarding the collective relationship and responsibilities. Every attempt has been made to make the renewal process easy, and in many cases, what seems to be a major issue can be solved very easily simply by talking to someone at ITI World HQ or your Regional Office.

## The SDI Open Water Scuba Diver Instructor: Part 2

### Professional Responsibilities of the OWSDI

Now that we know what it takes to become an SDI OWSDI we will discuss the SDI Code of Ethics and Conduct as well as the related professional responsibilities that reinforce the Code of Ethics. While some of the responsibilities described may seem somewhat general, they are issues often overlooked and worth discussing.

#### SDI Code of Ethics and Conduct

The following items apply to all SDI professionals:

- Sport diving is recognized as carrying a degree of risk and responsibility not normally associated with other recreational sports.
- We believe an individual should not be qualified as a SDI diver unless those empowered to qualify the person would allow them to buddy or teach their loved ones recreational diving.
- The professional always maintains their equipment and never begins a dive with defective equipment.
- The professional strives to maintain an attitude of professionalism and objectivity, and supports the concept of safety in recreational diving.
- The professional will not encourage or recruit other individuals to dive recreationally if unqualified.
- The professional will make every effort to pass on their knowledge to novice recreational divers and the diving community if requested to do so, whether through formal instruction, answering questions or via appropriate publication in books,journal and magazines.
- The professional strives to encourage and practice an awareness of conservation of the underwater environment at all times.
- The professional, by virtue of his or her voluntary membership, recognizes a responsibility and obligation to promote SDI and TDI, and support the official decisions as adopted by SDI and TDI; in fulfilling this responsibility and obligation, SDI and TDI members shall:
  - Publicly support SDI and TDI as organizations.
  - Make every effort to bring about necessary changes in a professional manner by direct contact with those fellow SDI and TDI members who are in positions of authority and responsibility.
- Every member has an obligation to report violations of SDI and/or TDI Standards and the Code of Ethics.
- Every member should strive to set an example of professional behavior and ethical conduct in all activities including, public speaking, articles and books, and various forms of Internet style discourse.
- Unwarranted critical comment and deliberate inflammatory statements of diving peers is inappropriate and undesirable.

 The professional responsibilities are more than just the knowledge and experience gained getting to this point; a dive professional is an ambassador to the community for the scuba industry. They must present themselves in a positive, professional manner especially when they are teaching students or have responsibility for a group. To maintain a professional image and meet those professional responsibilities they must adhere to the guidelines on the following pages.

### Professional Responsibilities of the Open Water Scuba Diver Instructor

#### Appearance

Wearing appropriate attire for each situation portrays a professional image. If the facility has a staff dress code, all dive professionals must follow that dress code. Many facilities require the dive professional to wear a shirt bearing the store logo while teaching. For the classroom setting, a collared shirt with slacks or casual dress shorts (no cut offs) portrays a professional image, while a T-shirt and casual shorts are more appropriate for the pool/confined water or open water. Certainly when teaching in a resort location, other attire may be appropriate. When all dive staff adhere to a predetermined appearance or dress code, it portrays a cohesive team that is organized and also instills confidence and trust in the customer. This appearance must then be followed up with adherence to other responsibilities, the next of which is punctuality.

#### Punctuality

Perhaps the most important thing a professional can do is make a good first impression. This impression starts even before the first word is spoken. The dive professional should plan to arrive at least 15 to 30 minutes before class starts depending on how much preparation must be done beforehand. The classroom should be checked to make sure all teaching aids and visual aids are available and working. All equipment that is needed for pool/confined water session must be ready and functioning properly. It is a good idea to have an extra set of equipment available should a problem arise with one in use. If the class is to end on time, it must start when it is scheduled to start. If the class starts late it will end late. Students may have made plans based on the schedule that was posted when they signed up for the class. They may have told family or babysitters when they could be expected home. Should the class get abnormally delayed time after time, they may become upset and the dive professional will quickly lose their credibility.

Remember, if everything is ready to go when the students arrive for the class, pool or open water dives, not only will everything take place on time but the student will leave with a good first impression.

#### Equipment Use

As discussed in the previous section on appearance, the dive professional and dive staff must maintain a professional image. Since scuba diving involves both above and below water interaction with the customers, it is important that the SDI OWSDI carry over that image to their underwater appearance. Dive professionals must use equipment sold by the store with which they are affiliated. This equipment should be top of the line, fairly new if not brand new and replaced every year or two. Students will look to the dive professionals as experts on equipment. They will want to emulate what they see these individuals using. The equipment must be maintained as required and any visual inspection stickers must be up to date. Old worn out equipment doesn't indicate an experienced diver, it indicates someone who doesn't care about their appearance or well-being. It may also give the impression the dive professional does not believe the newer equipment is as good as the equipment made in the past.

Keeping in mind the first impression and how that builds confidence and trust in the customer, the in-water portion of the course is where the customer needs to have 100% trust in the dive professional. This may be the first time the customer is going for a dive or they may be beginning a new aspect of diving, so having their trust is paramount; and if the SDI OWSDI's equipment is well maintained and looks new this will help establish that trust.

#### Preparedness

If the dive professional is punctual this will help them to be prepared and if they are neither of these it will be obvious to the customer. The dive professional must prepare for every course they will be conducting. This means knowing what information or skills will be covered for the upcoming lesson. They should try to anticipate questions the students may have and then answer these questions with the information that is presented. Knowing the audience will help in planning. Is the class made up of young students as well as older individuals? If so, what analogies can be used to explain an idea to both age levels so they will all understand?

Anticipate situations that may occur (play the "what if?" game) especially for in-water sessions. *Always think ahead.* Thinking ahead will allow proper planning and appropriate reaction in the event an unusual situation arises.

A good practice is to mentally prepare for the course by going through all the motions; this is better done in a place where there are no distractions. By being mentally and physically prepared the SDI OWSDI and the students will experience a better course.

#### Answering Questions

It should be clear by now, there are a lot of elements to cover in order to be prepared for a course. Another crucial element is the instructor's ability to answer questions the students may have in a prompt and confident manner. The OWSDI should be able to answer these questions by drawing from their current knowledge or experience but perhaps the best way to prepare is to read the materials the students read. When an OWSDI has an assistant instructor assisting with a course, it is the instructor's responsibility to tell the assistant when they should and when they should not answer questions asked by the students. The instructor may wish to have all questions directed to him.

> If the instructor allows the assistant instructor to answer questions, the assistant instructor must be "on the same page" as the instructor and not be contradictory with their answer.

It is the instructor's responsibly to make sure the assistant instructor knows exactly what's expected of him.

The more often courses are taught by an OWSDI the easier this process becomes but it is still a very good habit to review the text the students studied, just in case something was forgotten or the text has been updated. The OWSDI will need to learn to think on his feet as all questions asked by students may pertain to the current topic being discussed. This leads us into the need to stay current not only with materials but also certifications.

#### Staying Current with Certifications

CPR, first aid and oxygen administration are required for certification as an SDI OWSDI. It is the dive professional's responsibility to keep these certifications current; most must be renew every two years. Staying current with CPR, first aid and oxygen administration is not just a matter of adhering to standards; in the unfortunate event an accident does occur the dive professional will know what to do and how to handle the scene. CPR and first aid are an evolving and ever changing science and it is a prudent dive professional that stays abreast of the changes.

Divers Continuing to LearnBeing prepared with the latest techniques and the basic equipment needed for CPR and first aid will not only help alleviate some of the stress associated with a diving accident, it will also produce a more positive outcome for the victim.

#### Continuing to Learn

Just like any other facet of life there is always more to learn, and no matter how long a dive professional has been involved with diving, they still haven't learned everything there is to know about the sport. Information is constantly changing. By continuing to expand their knowledge they will stay informed of these new ideas and will demonstrate to others that continuing education is needed at all levels. There are many avenues to continuing education from simply auditing a course taught by someone else to enrolling in a course to gain a certification that is not currently held. The simple moral here is: keep the mind open to new ideas, knowledge and techniques; they can all come in handy when a new situation is faced. The experience gained as an instructor will help tremendously when moving through the higher professional levels.

### Advancing Through the Professional Levels

SDI has many certification levels in-line with and above the OWSDI, each building on the previous and expanding the abilities of the dive professional. The following is a list of the certifications that can be obtained.

#### Specialty and TDI Instructor

An SDI OWSDI is the professional primarily responsible for training and certifying sport divers. After successful completion of both the SDI Instructor Development Course and the Instructor Evaluation Course, the SDI Instructor may independently conduct all core diver and leadership courses from SDI Open Water Scuba Diver through Assistant Instructor, as well as the SDI Advanced Adventure specialty. An SDI Instructor must be separately qualified and approved for each additional specialty diver course they wish to offer.

TDI Pro CardA TDI Instructor is the professional primarily responsible for training and certifying technical divers. Naturally, certification as an SDI Instructor (or equivalent) is a prerequisite, as well as certification as a technical diver at the appropriate level. After successfully completing a technical instructor course for each technical level, the TDI Instructor may conduct technical diver and technical divemaster programs at that level.

#### Course Director

SDI Course Director is an advanced instructor rating within the SDI curriculum. An SDI Course Director at this level may independently conduct the SDI Instructor Development Course (but not the Instructor Evaluation Course). The Course Director may also qualify SDI Instructors and SDI Assistant Instructors to teach approved SDI Specialties. The prerequisites for SDI Course Director include documented teaching experience in a wide range of SDI Diver and Dive Leadership programs.

It should be noted that there is not a 'Course Director' rating in the TDI curriculum.

#### Instructor Trainer

'Instructor Trainer' is the highest leadership level in the curriculum of SDI, TDI and ERDI. As this title implies, SDI, TDI and ERDI Instructor Trainers are responsible for training, evaluating, and certifying SDI, TDI and ERDI Instructors, as well as SDI Course Directors. Prerequisites for SDI, TDI or ERDI Instructor Trainer include significant and extensive experience as an instructor. SDI has a single Instructor Trainer rating (with the exception of CPR, VIP and Solo ratings), while TDI has an Instructor Trainer rating at each technical level.

These levels of training are what lie ahead for the OWSDI who chooses to advance. Each level provides the ability to pass on more experience and enthusiasm to those divers wanting to learn more. By achieving the higher levels of certification, the dive professional will be able to lead their customers on a journey of exploration and excitement.

To recap, paying attention to one's appearance; being punctual; using well maintained equipment sold by the facility they work for; being very well prepared; answering students' questions correctly; staying current with certifications; and continuing to learn and better oneself are goals that all members should always be certain they accomplish. SDI members who are remiss in any of these areas may end up with quality assurance inquiries and risk losing their active status, or worse - potential expulsion.

International Training takes quality assurance very seriously. As previously discussed, members are direct representatives of International Training. As such, members are expected to act professionally and maintain that professionalism throughout their career with International Training. Quality assurance is tested in several different ways, and specific guidelines have been established for responding to quality assurance concerns. The following section describes the quality assurance procedures and action steps.

### Quality Assurance

As a professional member of a self-policing organization it is important to understand how the quality of training and the materials used in training are monitored. This section discusses how SDI does this and how feedback from those surveys and other annual administrative tasks can affect a member's status.

All quality assurance matters are handled at SDI/TDI/ERDI World Headquarters by the Training Department. This is to ensure that ITI Regional Offices and Sales Managers remain neutral. The information gleaned during the QA process is used to improve the materials and standards as well as return positive feedback to the dive professionals providing quality training.

#### General Quality Assurance (QA) Procedures

Quality assurance survey letters, more commonly known as QA Letters, are sent out to students who were recently certified by members in good standing. These letters are sent with a self-addressed, return postage paid envelope or electronically via e-mail course survey form to solicit information about the course the student just completed. The questions in the letters might ask about the materials used for the course, the maximum depth achieved during the course, and other information that will help the ITI Training Department understand the student's experience during the course. SDI wants this information so that it can maintain the quality of instruction and ensure that proper training materials were used. In addition to the letters, SDI occasionally receives unsolicited emails and phone calls from students. The feedback from these QA letters, emails or phone calls can be negative or positive and either way the member's file is updated.

Now that we have discussed the potential certifications that lie ahead, various member statuses and quality assurance procedures, it is important to know where to find all this information along with course specific standards. In the next section we will cover how to navigate through the SDI Standards and Procedures manual and where to locate the answers to most questions that arise during or before training.

### Using The SDI Standards and Procedures Manual

The SDI Standards and Procedures Manual is intended to be a guide to providing complete and enjoyable training to divers for the courses the OWSDI is qualified to teach. The SDI Standards and Procedures include not only standards for courses OWSDIs can teach but for all courses SDI/TDI/ERDI Instructors can teach. The OWSDI should reference the SDI Standards and Procedures to achieve consistency and quality. They outline the vital "core knowledge" that each student needs to master to achieve SDI certification. Finally, but no less important, the manual is intended to help effectively deliver the skills and knowledge students will actually need.

The SDI Standards and Procedures Manual is meant to be a "living manual" - updated on a regular basis, it is meant to grow and change throughout the OWSDI's career. From time to time member updates will be received; the OWSDI should be sure to incorporate these updates promptly so that their manual is always up to date.

#### How to Use the SDI Standards and Procedures Manual

The SDI Standards and Procedures Manual has intentionally been kept brief but concise. The manual consists of several parts, which are:

1. Introduction
1. Diver Standards
1. Diver Specialties
1. Leadership Standards
1. Appendix

Each part of the SDI Standards and Procedures Manual is designed to have the same look and flow. Parts 2 and 3 have a general course standard followed by the specific standards for each course. The general standards apply to all standards within that section. The course specific standards are listed in a logical order and follow the normal progression of training. When clarification is needed for a specific course, refer to the general standard at the beginning of that part first, then refer to the course specific standard. If the intent of the standard is still not clear, call or email the Training Department of SDI World Headquarters.

Each of these parts also contains the information needed in order to meet minimum standards. Minimum standards ensure proficiency at a given level and stipulate that the course content can be no less than what is required by the standard. The standard for the specific course being taught should be reviewed prior to teaching that particular course and should be reviewed again before completion to ensure the standard was met. If the instructor adheres to the standards, uses the course materials combined with their experience and knowledge they will produce a well-rounded and proficient diver.

All forms necessary to complete the administrative tasks associated with conducting a course will be found in Part Five (5) Appendix.

#### Part 1, Introduction Summary

- The Need for Standardized Instruction
  - Explains SDI/TDI/ERDI's progressive approach to consistency and excellence in instruction
- The Role of a Dive Professional
  - Emphasizes the important role the SDI Open Water Scuba Diver Instructor plays in the SDI/TDI/ERDI family
- Risk Management
  - Directs the dive professional to further information to protect them against a problem that could consume their career; of course, they always want to be the best OWSDI possible
- Tips to Becoming a Great Instructor
  - Tips that offer information to help them be a better teacher and a respected professional in dive instruction
- How to Conduct an SDI/TDI/ERDI Scuba Course
  - Covers the general approach to scheduling a scuba course and enrolling students: focuses on the logistics and details (medical and legal) of scheduling training sessions, organizing students, collecting class fees and motivating students to attend all of the course sessions

#### Part 2, Diver Standards Summary

Part Two (2) contains standards for the core SDI training programs including Snorkeling, Scuba Discovery Program, Inactive Diver Program as well as the Advanced Diver Development and Master Diver certifications. Some of these programs the OWSDI may have the ability to teach. When developing a path for a diver wanting to continue their education, this is the part to refer to.

#### Part 3, Specialties Summary

Part Three (3) has all the course specific specialty standards offered by SDI. The SDI OWSDI can teach a number of these specialties (once certified for each specific level). When working with a diver to determine their interests in diving, the OWSDI can refer to this section to inform them of the prerequisites for the courses and what the courses will entail. As noted earlier, this is also where the OWSDI would review what is required during a course prior to teaching it.

#### Part 4, Leadership Standards Summary

SDI’s Leadership Course standards can be found in Part Four (4) of the Standards and Procedures Manual. After successful completion of the SDI OWSDI course the next step can be mapped out. The OWSDI may wish to gain additional specialty instructor ratings or become a TDI Instructor and this section will make clear what will be expected.

#### Part 5, Appendix Summary

All forms necessary for completing administrative tasks can be found in this part, from student registration forms to the proper form to use when reporting an incident/accident. Part Five (5) also contains all of the forms that are required at the beginning of a course such as the general liability release form and the medical history form.

All of the various parts of the SDI Instructor manual can be found in the member section of our website <https://www.tdisdi.com> as well as on the Standards and Procedures CD and the printed version of the SDI Standards and Procedures. SDI's Training Department routinely updates these standards and provides member updates quarterly during the year. At the beginning of each year all standards are updated on the website and it is the responsibility of the dive professional to ensure these updates are noted in their SDI Instructor Manual.

### Chapter 1 and 2 Summary

In the first two sections the history and philosophy of ITI, the parent company of Scuba Diving International (SDI), as well as an overview of what to expect during the SDI Open Water Scuba Diver Instructor course have been provided. The SDI Standards and Procedures Manual was reviewed, covering where to find the standards for courses that the OWSDI can teach and how to maintain an active teaching status. This chapter will serve as a reference point as the course progresses and information is needed to prepare for academic or in-water presentations, or to follow along while assisting with a course.

## Dive Leader Risk Management: Part 1

### Inherent Risks in Scuba Diving

At some point in time, almost every experienced diver has told a family member or interested friend that diving is a safe sport. As a professional dive leader, it is a mistake to make that kind of statement to anyone, especially someone just entering the sport as a student diver. It simply is not an accurate statement. “Safe” literally means “without risk”. In fact, few things in life are absolutely safe. Diving, like many other adventure sports, definitely has some inherent risks.

The particular risks associated with diving are detailed in the Diving Physiology chapter of this manual. Among other issues, these risks include decompression sickness and barotraumas, marine-life injuries, physical exertion with increased demands upon the cardio-respiratory system, and the possibility of drowning.

Risk management refers to the various efforts and procedures intended to minimize the inherent risks of scuba diving.

> From the perspective of the diver, these inherent risks can be minimized through appropriate prerequisite training for all participants, followed by accurate application of the student's knowledge and skills during all subsequent diving activities.

Nevertheless, despite these precautions, the possibility of injury still exists. Thus there is a clear mandate for all participants to thoroughly understand and accept these risks. Furthermore, in today's litigious society, whenever any injury occurs there also is the distinct possibility of a lawsuit. Accordingly, from the perspective of the dive leader and dive facility, effective risk management further includes appropriate measures and strategies to mitigate the consequences of a participant's injury.

### Anatomy of a Lawsuit

A civil lawsuit generally consists of two parties: the plaintiff, who files the suit seeking compensation for damages; and the defendant (or defendants), whom the plaintiff alleges is responsible for those damages. In an injury case the plaintiff is normally the individual who actually suffered the injury, though in the case of a fatal injury it also can be the family or estate of the deceased. In order to be successful in the lawsuit, the plaintiff must demonstrate four elements, as outlined below; and normally, to be successful, each of these elements needs to be established merely by a preponderance of the evidence (which is often interpreted to mean that 51% of the evidence is in favor of the plaintiff).

1. The plaintiff must be able to show damages, either financial or physical, or both.
1. The plaintiff must be able to show that the defendant (or defendants) had a duty to provide training or supervision in an atmosphere of reasonable safety.
1. The plaintiff must be able to show that, by acts of commission or omission, the defendant (or defendants) breached that duty.
1. The plaintiff must be able to show that his damages are the direct result of negligent performance by the defendant (or defendants).

In addition to actual damages, some jurisdictions also allow the plaintiff to pursue punitive damages, which are intended to further “punish” the defendant (or defendants) for deliberately injurious actions or other behavior deemed to be unusually egregious in nature.

It is an unfortunate fact that in the legal system within the USA, almost anyone can be sued for anything. The above elements need not be proven in order to file suit; instead, these elements only need to be alleged. Once a suit is filed, both the plaintiff and defendant (or defendants) are entitled to "discovery," which is a detailed process whereby each gathers evidence through formal demands for information and documents, and also through depositions (examinations under oath) of the involved parties and other witnesses. This discovery process is completed prior to trial, and the relevant information, documents, and testimony obtained during the discovery process may be introduced as evidence at trial.

As a matter of routine in the United States, when first filing suit the plaintiff normally names as a defendant every conceivable party who may be involved in any way, either directly or indirectly, in this matter. It might include the dive leader who was supervising diving activities when the plaintiff's injury occurred. It might include the dive facility that rented or last serviced the plaintiff's equipment. It may also include the instructor or dive center who conducted some diver training program for the plaintiff several years prior to the incident. In some cases a defendant may also file a counter-suit against the plaintiff, or against one or more co-defendants. Eventually, as the discovery process continues, some of these defendants may be dismissed from the suit; however, prior to reaching this point, it is likely that each defendant will have already incurred significant legal expenses related to their own defense.

Though the above comments relate primarily to the legal system in the USA, it is important to note that those dive professionals and dive facilities located outside the USA are not necessarily immune from such lawsuits. The courts in the United States generally extend tremendous latitude to US-based plaintiffs. Further, a plaintiff will often be able to establish a US "presence" for a foreign dive instructor or dive facility by identifying their use of a US-based sales agent or representative, or by simply demonstrating that they directly or indirectly offer their services to USA-based clientele.

### Defensive Teaching and Supervising

In any civil lawsuit, ultimately the actions of the dive instructor (as a defendant) will be judged against those of a hypothetical "reasonably prudent" professional, that is, did this individual perform his duties and fulfill his responsibilities in a manner consistent with that which is expected of a competent and capable dive professional?

The dive leader's best defense in any lawsuit is that he acted in full compliance with established protocols. These protocols are detailed in the SDI and TDI Standards and Procedures Manuals. The prudent professional will ensure that every training program is conducted according to standards, that every required topic is appropriately addressed, and that each student becomes proficient in all required skills.

> The prudent professional will exercise appropriate judgment and discretion. For example, the SDI and TDI standards specify maximum student-to-instructor ratios for every training program. It is important to recognize that these are maximums, under ideal conditions. Whenever conditions are less than ideal, these ratios should be reduced.

In addition, the prudent professional will never allow an individual under his charge to engage in activities for which that individual is not qualified, nor allow an individual under his charge to dive with malfunctioning or inadequate equipment.

While supervising students or certified divers, the prudent professional will expect the unexpected. Though the dive leader may exercise great effort and care in presenting information during a dive briefing, he should never assume that everything will go exactly as planned. The dive leader must recognize that, sooner or later, a student or diver may suddenly divert into some behavior that is exactly opposite of what has been briefed. The prudent professional will anticipate the various contingencies that might occur, and will formulate a plan to quickly and appropriately respond.

### Student Training Records

To defend against any later allegations of negligent or inadequate training, it is vitally important to thoroughly document each student's training activities.

The SDI and TDI Student Training Record folders are specially designed to document a student's successful completion of all academic, confined water and open water sessions, as well as all written tests and skills performance. The folder itself includes the medical statement and liability release forms (each of these forms will be addressed in more detail later). Additional documentation that should be inserted into this folder includes the student's completed Knowledge Quest / Scuba IQ Review exercises, written exams, and clearance by a medical professional (if needed).

As a training program progresses, each student's training records should be appropriately updated following each session. Whenever a student encounters some initial difficulty in mastering a skill or academic concept, the appropriate review and remediation also should be documented to demonstrate that in fact the shortcoming was addressed and that the student subsequently mastered this skill or concept.

Naturally, the training records should identify the instructor who conducted each session. It also will be helpful to note other dive leaders who were involved in the training. As an additional precautionary measure, a copy of the class roster also may be added to the folder, listing all students participating in the program, in the event that someday they may be called upon as witnesses to verify the adequacy of the training activities.

All training records should be preserved for a period of seven years. At some dive facilities it is the responsibility of the individual instructor who conducted the training to maintain these records. In other cases it will be the dive facility itself that maintains these records.

### Medical Statement

Diving is a physically demanding activity and, as such, it clearly requires a certain level of health and fitness; lacking appropriate health and fitness, the individual potentially will be placed at increased risk.

Both SDI and TDI have standard medical statement forms that each participant in all SDI and TDI training programs are required to complete. The medical statement is basically a screening tool, to ensure that an individual possesses the prerequisite level of general health and fitness to participate in diving. This form must be completed in its entirety (with no questions left blank), then signed and dated by the student; the medical statement for a minor also must be signed and dated by that student's parent or legal guardian. If a student answers "yes" to any question on this form, it does not necessarily preclude him or her from participation; however, with any "yes" answer the student will be required to obtain written clearance from a medical professional prior to participating in any in-water training activities. It also should be noted that if the student in question happens to be a physician, that student cannot provide his own medical clearance but instead must obtain written clearance from another medical professional.

The instructor conducting the program should review the medical statement with the students and appropriately address any particular issues or concerns that might arise.

> The instructor, however, should never coach a student regarding his answers to any of the medical questions, and never create any hint of suggestion that a student should falsely answer "no" to any question on this form.

Students always must be encouraged to answer these questions honestly and accurately, since concealing any applicable medical condition might expose that student to unnecessary risk.

Any "yes" answer on the medical statement requires evaluation by a qualified medical professional, to determine whether an individual possesses the appropriate level of general health and fitness to participate in diving. The instructor, as a layman, clearly lacks the medical qualifications to make this type of evaluation and to authoritatively clear an individual for diving. Despite the fact that a medical condition might appear minor and inconsequential, in no case should the instructor intentionally overlook any "yes" answer on the medical statement and allow that student to participate in in-water activities without medical clearance; doing so can easily lead to a claim of negligence if any injury subsequently occurs. In fact, this requirement for medical clearance, when indicated, is one of the provisions itemized in every standard liability insurance policy within the dive industry, and failure to adhere to this requirement may well void the insurance coverage for both the dive professional and the dive facility.

On occasion, the situation may arise where there is some reason to question a student's health and fitness for diving, even though that student has answered "no" to each question on the medical statement. It might involve something as obvious as a large surgical scar over the center of a student's chest, or something less tangible such as significant overexertion while performing a relatively benign physical task. Whenever any such question arises, the dive leader should address the issue with the student and if any concern lingers the dive leader should request medical clearance prior to further participation. At the same time, even with clearance by a medical professional, the ultimate decision for accepting a student into any training program rests with the instructor.

As a matter of routine, most instructors, assistant instructors, and dive facilities have the students complete their medical statement forms at the beginning of each course.

> It is important to recognize that on occasion, especially in the case of entry-level divers enrolled in an Open Water Scuba Diver course, there can be some disappointment and possible resentment when an individual first learns that he will need medical clearance only after they arrive for the initial training session.

To avoid this situation, conscientious dive leaders and dive facilities will make the medical statement available to each student ahead of time, the student might be provided with a photocopy of the medical statement at the time of enrollment in the course, or may be instructed to carefully review a copy of the medical statement, which has been posted on the dive facility's website. When medical clearance is required, the student also should be provided with the appropriate SDI or TDI form for the physician's use.

SDI and TDI Standards require each participant to complete a medical statement for all training programs, but do not require a medical statement for participation in other non-training activities. It must be noted, however, that local regulations can vary, and more-restrictive local regulations will supersede the SDI and TDI Standards. For example, in some jurisdictions it may be required that every student obtains medical clearance prior to any in-water training activities, and in other areas a medical statement might be required even for non-training activities.

### Liability Releases

The liability release is effectively a legal contract between the participant and the dive leader and/or dive facility, within which the participant acknowledges and accepts the inherent risks of scuba diving and also agrees to hold the dive leader and/or dive facility harmless if injury should occur. In some cases a properly executed liability release will provide sufficient basis for dismissal of a lawsuit. In other cases the liability release will serve to mitigate damages.

SDI and TDI each have standard liability release forms that apply to each of their respective diver training programs; there also is a supplemental liability release form for the SDI Solo Diver course, and additional SDI liability release forms for non-training activities including guided dives and boat dives.

In each training program the instructor conducting the program should review the applicable liability release with the students and appropriately address any particular issues or concerns that might arise. Each individual must complete the form in its entirety (with no lines left blank), and under no circumstances should the dive leader allow any of the pre-printed text to be modified in any manner. Each paragraph on the form must be initialed, the form must be signed and dated by the participant, and the form for any minor must also be signed and dated by that student's parent or legal guardian; finally the form should be signed and dated by a third-party witness (such as another student).

Similarly, in non-training activities the dive leader supervising the activities should review the applicable liability release with the participants and address any issues or concerns. Again, this form should be completed in its entirety, each paragraph should be initialed by the participant, and the form should be signed, dated, and witnessed.

In order for the liability release to be deemed valid, most jurisdictions require that the participant be allowed sufficient time to reflect on its contents. In addition, some jurisdictions also stipulate that the participant be given an opportunity to discuss this document with other family members (who might be impacted by the release) and perhaps to consult with their own legal counsel (when they feel that such is warranted). It might well be argued that duress exists when an individual is asked to sign a liability release at the very last moment, after the class already has started or after the dive boat already has left the dock, especially if there is any suggestion of peer pressure or financial forfeiture associated with a participant's decision to sign or not sign that release. Clearly, any perception of duress might well invalidate the document.

As a matter of routine most instructors, assistant instructors and dive facilities have the students complete their liability release forms at the beginning of each course. However, to avoid any perception of duress, conscientious dive leaders and dive facilities also make the liability release available to each student ahead of time, the student might be provided with a photocopy of the liability release at the time of enrollment in the course, or they may be instructed to carefully review a copy of the liability release, which has been posted on the dive facility's website.

As the students are completing these forms the dive leader should carefully explain that if they have any reservations about participating, they may withdraw without any loss of face and with a full refund.

### Liability Insurance for Dive Leaders

Affordable liability insurance for dive leaders, as well as dive centers and dive boats, is available through SDI and TDI. Dive leaders operating in most geographic locations are required to have liability insurance; in some locations it is optional but still highly recommended. As outlined above, even if a dive leader has apparently done nothing wrong, he still can be named as a defendant in a lawsuit, perhaps based solely upon the fact that at some point in time that dive leader has crossed paths with the plaintiff.

In the event that the dive leader is named as a defendant, the liability insurance will provide legal representation and cover the cost of defense.

> In the event that the lawsuit results in a judgment against the dive leader, the liability insurance will cover the monetary award. Of course each liability policy specifies the maximum dollar amount of coverage, though increased levels of coverage also are available as an option under the individual policies offered through SDI and TDI.

Currently four types of individual liability insurance policies are available through SDI and TDI. The first is intended for dive leaders operating in the USA, Mexico and the Caribbean. The second is for those in Canada. The third is for those in Australia. The fourth is for other locations but is intended only for those dive leaders who do not interact with citizens of the USA. In each area, coverage is provided according to the dive leader's professional certification, SDI Instructor, SDI Assistant Instructor, or SDI Divemaster. Coverage also is available for those dive leaders who are no longer active in the training or supervision of divers. As you might expect, the cost varies according to the dive leader's professional certification and current activities.

The standard liability insurance policies available through SDI and TDI cover only activities at the sport diver level. Additional coverage is available by endorsement (currently at no additional charge) for TDI Technical Instructors and TDI Technical Divemasters, to cover activities at the technical diver level. The same liability insurance available through SDI and TDI also can be extended (again, currently at no additional charge for technical activities) to cover any activities conducted under the auspices of another approved diver training organization.

The standard liability insurance policies available through SDI and TDI do not provide coverage when the dive leader's personally owned equipment is rented or loaned to a diver under his charge. Such coverage is available as an option (at an additional charge). Lacking such coverage, the dive leader should recognize that he should never rent or loan personal equipment to a student diver or supervised certified diver. Instead, when the dive leader desires to have back-up equipment on hand during diving activities, it should be equipment from the dive facility's rental inventory (the dive facility normally has insurance coverage for any equipment provided to customers).

As noted, insurance coverage is also available through SDI and TDI for dive centers and dive boats. In some cases, coverage under these policies can also be extended to individual dive leaders. It is important to note, however, that such coverage only applies to those diving activities that are official functions of that particular dive center or dive boat. This coverage will not apply to any activities conducted independently by the dive leader, or to any duties the dive leader performs for another dive center or dive boat.

### In the Event of a Dive Accident

Whenever any dive-related accident or injury occurs, there is the possibility of a lawsuit at a later date. It might happen when a supervised certified diver panics at depth, and bolts towards the surface while holding his breath. It might involve a student who accidentally drops a weight belt on his foot. It might even arise from an incident in which the dive leader initially had no involvement, but to which the dive leader responded and rendered assistance.

The primary concern in any incident is to care for the victim. Next, the victim's equipment should be secured; in the event of a serious incident, the local authorities may want to take custody of the equipment for further examination. Finally, the dive leader should begin to gather all relevant information, using the applicable SDI or TDI Accident/Incident Report form as a guide.

Naturally, the dive leader should be sympathetic to the victim and his family or friends. At no time should the dive leader make any comments to the victim, his family and friends, or to the authorities regarding anyone's potential liability. This is no place for opinion or speculation. All information that is reported should be completely factual in nature and should be limited only to those circumstances the dive leader actually observed first-hand. The dive leader should always politely decline any requests by the news media for information regarding the incident.

As soon as possible after the incident, the dive leader should fax the completed accident/incident report to SDI/TDI Headquarters or your regional office. If the incident occurred during training, copies of the student's medical statement, liability release and all training records should be forwarded with the report. If the incident occurred during some other supervised non-training activity, copies of the diver's liability release and any other available information should be forwarded with the report.

If the dive leader has insurance coverage through SDI and TDI, then SDI/TDI Headquarters will forward the report and related documentation to the insurance company. In some cases, on behalf of the insurance company, SDI/TDI Headquarters may initiate its own investigation of the incident. Of course, the dive leader is obliged to respond immediately to any request or further inquiry by SDI/TDI Headquarters.

Without doubt, the dive leader is also obliged to cooperate with any investigation conducted by the local authorities. On occasion, the authorities may request a written report from the dive leader; whenever possible, the dive leader should submit the very same accident/incident report to the authorities as was submitted to SDI/TDI Headquarters.

> In general the dive leader should try to avoid the creation of multiple reports, as even a minor variance between the reports may later prove to be problematic at trial.

If by chance the incident occurred during a training program that was conducted under the auspices of another diver training organization, then the appropriate reporting procedures should be followed as specified by that other training organization. Similarly, if the dive leader has his insurance coverage elsewhere, then the appropriate reporting procedures should also be followed as specified by that other insurance company. As is the case with reports submitted to the authorities, as noted above, the dive leader should try to avoid the creation of multiple reports, and whenever possible the same report should be submitted to the other training organization and/or other insurance company as was submitted to ITI Headquarters.

## Dive Leader Risk Management: Part 2

### Emergency Procedures

An accident is the least desired situation a dive professional ever wants to face. Odds are though, the longer a dive professional is actively involved with diving the greater the chance he will experience an accident. It may be a small matter, such as a cut or bruise, or as catastrophic as a fatality. It just can’t be helped. What the dive professional can and must do then is try to prevent accidents and be prepared if an accident occurs.

It is important for the dive professional to have an emergency management plan for each dive location he plans to use. This emergency management should include:

Contact numbers for local Emergency Medical Services (EMS), police or sheriff department, Coast Guard and medical facility.
Diver’s Alert Network (DAN) emergency and non-emergency numbers.
Check list of items available at the site such as telephone or radio, oxygen available, first aid kit and a copy of the appropriate incident report form.
It is recommended an incident report be completed any time medical attention is sought or a recommendation made for the diver to seek medical attention. The best precaution to take is to fill out a report for any incident/accident that takes place.

> Should an accident occur, all attention should be immediately focused on the individual involved in the accident.

If they are missing, try to determine where and when the individual was last seen. Next, decide who is qualified to help with a search. Choosing the people to search for a missing diver means making sure they are qualified, willing and that by putting them back in the water you do not jeopardize their safety. Find willing and able divers with the least amount of residual nitrogen in their bodies. Never jeopardize individuals needlessly. It may be better to wait until more qualified help arrives before starting a search. The most qualified individual on the site, which is most likely the dive professional, should take charge as soon as he finds out a diver is missing or has had an accident. If the individual involved is from the dive professional's group of divers then the responsibility to take charge falls to that dive professional.

The individual in charge should direct the management plan upon being made aware of the situation. He should assign someone to:

- Contact Emergency Medical Services
- Control the scene
- Take notes as to what happens and when
- Interview witnesses and document their comments

#### Contact Emergency Medical Services

As stated previously, the individual in charge must have an accident management plan for the site he is diving. This should include the person(s) and/or entities to contact if an accident occurs. Contact may be via the phone, radio, sending a bystander or driving for help. In remote areas make sure cell phones work and have coverage, or know where the closest landline is located. Someone may have to be sent to meet EMS and bring them to the dive site if it is located away from common use areas.

#### Control the Scene

Control the scene by making sure everyone assigned a task is undertaking the task. Assign additional individuals to help if needed. A well-coordinated scene will make everything flow much easier and show preparedness on the dive professional’s part.

Once the individual is out of the water their equipment must be secured. The dive professional in charge should have an impartial third party evaluate the equipment with him and document those findings. Take photos of the equipment if a camera is available. These photos should become part of the report to the agency.

- Does the equipment appear to be working properly?
- How much air is left in the cylinder?
- Were the valves on the cylinders open and how many turns did it take to turn them off?
- Do the gauges appear to be functioning properly?
- Is any required item missing?

Once this review is finished, both the dive professional and the third party participant should sign and date the document. Turn the air off (don’t forget to count the turns) to prevent the remaining air from leaking out and making it appear the diver may have run out of air thereby causing the accident.

#### Taking Notes

When taking notes, it is beneficial if a chronological order of events can be documented so that later when the dive professional makes his accident report he has a good idea of what happened, when it happened, and who did what. It is extremely easy to get caught up in what is happening at the moment and forget the sequence of events.

> Don't rely on memory, have someone write it down. This information comes in very handy should any legal action occur due to the accident.

Make sure this is the note taker's only task so he can be completely focused on taking notes. This individual does not need to be a diver.

#### Interviewing Witnesses

Assign someone to interview witnesses in the area as to what they observed. Make sure their comments are factual and not simply their opinions. It is recommended witnesses be interviewed separately as to not influence each other's recollection of what transpired. In the event someone needs to contact the witnesses later make sure the interviewer collects the witnesses' contact information such as:

- Name
- Address
- Phone number
- Email if possible

It is guaranteed that the more severe the accident, the more probable it is an investigator will contact the witness(es).

#### Accident Reporting

Once the accident victim has been turned over to the proper authorities and the scene has been secured, the dive professional must collect all of the information gathered by the individuals assigned to take notes and interview witnesses. This information will help the dive professional when he writes the accident report.

The dive professional should write the report as soon as realistically possible following the accident, while the event is still fresh in his memory. Because most insurance companies require notification of an accident within a certain amount of time, failure to promptly report the accident may create a coverage problem. The sooner the better is the best advice when it comes to completing and providing an accident report.

The dive professional should use the appropriate accident form and provide only the information requested. Dive professionals should not provide any information to anyone other than ITI and their insurance agent. More importantly, dive professionals should not provide any information to a third party. If a statement must be made to the local authorities, only the facts should be provided. The dive professional should be cooperative with them and avoid voicing any judgments, statements or opinions regarding the accident. Talking with the media should be avoided at all costs.

Remember, anyone can be named in a lawsuit at anytime, especially those in charge of a group. In the event of an accident, it’s important that the dive professional document as many of the facts as possible to protect him and other responders.

#### CPR and First Aid

The initial certification as a dive professional requires that proof of current CPR and first aid training be submitted. After the initial certification it is the dive professional’s responsibility to maintain this training. Within the SDI/TDI system an individual has the option to take the CPROX1st or the CPROX1st AED program to keep this requirement satisfied.

### Summary: Chapters 3 and 4

This section covered various aspects of risk management and how to teach defensively. If these suggestions and procedures are followed when an accident/incident occurs, the process will be less traumatic and end with a more favorable outcome. Accidents can and will happen. An OWSDI can minimize the negative outcome of those accidents with proper training, proper planning and careful organization. Being prepared for an accident will help prevent accidents.

## Diving Physics

In the divemaster program, diving physics and physiology were covered in great depth. Here is a brief review of the topics focusing on the most important information. The formulas used in diving and their practical application will also be reviewed. Should an OWSDI candidate have difficulties with any of this information, he should thoroughly review the SDI Divemaster materials. A formulas sheet is provided in the appendix of this manual for use.

A general understanding of physics is a key component in the overall body of knowledge that is expected of a dive professional. The laws of physics are equally applicable both above and below the water's surface. A dive leader should attempt to convey pertinent information to every student with whom he comes into contact; and that knowledge should be tailored according to the recipient's level of training. Any additional information should be reserved for that individual who expresses further interest. A dive leader can never know all there is to know about the science of diving and the theories backing that science up, but the real art is knowing when that knowledge should be shared.

### Physical Properties of Water

#### Density of Water

Water is approximately 800 times denser than air. Therefore the diver will experience more resistance underwater, which may lead to increased workload, breathing and air consumption, shortening available bottom time and contributing greatly to diver fatigue. This is one reason control of a diver's profile or trim and buoyancy are important skills to master.

#### Refraction of Light in Water

Light rays bend, or refract, when they pass from one medium to another of different density. The amount of bending is determined by the refractive indices of the two media. Because the structure of the human eye is adapted to sharply focus light rays entering the eye from air, when light rays enter the eye from water, the degree of refraction generally exceeds the eye's focusing range, and thus the image appears blurry. This is why a mask is used to restore focus underwater. The mask creates additional refraction as light rays pass first from the water through the tempered glass of the faceplate and into the air space within the mask, before entering the eye. Due to this refraction, objects appear about 33% larger and about 25% closer to the diver.

#### Diffraction of Light in Water

Light rays normally travel in a straight line through a medium. Any minor obstacles encountered along the way will cause the light rays to be deflected and become scattered to some extent. This scattering, or divergence, is known as diffraction. Accordingly, the seemingly contradictory situation arises where refraction continues to make nearby objects appear closer to the diver than they actually are, while at the same time diffraction makes other objects in the middle and long distance appear to be even farther away.

#### Color Loss in Water

As explained in the divemaster course, as sunlight passes through the denser medium of water, some wavelengths of light are absorbed. The longest wavelengths (red) are absorbed the quickest by water, and this occurs at a relatively shallow depth. To remember the order colors are lost the acronym ROY G BIV can be used: Red (shallowest), orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet (deepest).

#### Transmission of Sound in Water

The speed of sound depends upon the medium through which it passes, and sound tends to travel faster in denser mediums. The precise speed of sound in water depends upon pressure, temperature, and salinity, but in general sound travels about four times faster through water than air.

#### Thermal Conductivity in Water

The thermal conductivity of any substance depends upon a number of variables including its density and overall structure. Water is a far more efficient thermal conductor than air. In fact, the relative thermal conductivity factor for water is about 6.0, while for air it is only about 0.025; thus water will whisk heat away from a diver's body approximately 25 times faster than air. Depending on water temperature divers must plan to use the appropriate exposure suit for conditions.

#### Buoyancy

Archimedes of Syracuse (287-212 BC) (my man!) discovered the principle known in physics as Archimedes' Principle. This principle states: "Any object, wholly or partly immersed in a fluid, is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object."

##### How This Principle Relates to Diving

When an object is placed in water, it displaces an amount of water equal to its own volume. If the object weighs less than the displaced water the object will float and is said to be positively buoyant. Conversely, if the object weighs more than the displaced water, the object will sink, or it is negatively buoyant. If the object weighs exactly the same as the displaced water, it will neither float nor sink, and instead it will simply hover in mid-water; it is neutrally buoyant.

Divers use three items to control their own buoyancy: lead weights, a BCD (buoyancy compensator device), and lung volume. Lead weights offset the positive buoyancy of their exposure suit and personal body composition. Air can be added or removed from the BCD (buoyancy compensator device) to maintain neutral buoyancy. But to fine tune buoyancy the diver must learn how to breathe properly and fine tune buoyancy with their lungs.

##### Saltwater versus Freshwater

Seawater contains salt and this salt contributes to the water's weight. A volume of seawater weighs more than an equal volume of freshwater. A liter of seawater weighs 1.03 kilograms, while a liter of freshwater weighs 1.0 kilograms. A cubic foot of seawater weighs 64 pounds, while a cubic foot of freshwater weighs 62.4 pounds.

##### Archimedean Calculations

To determine the buoyancy of an object, the diver must have several critical pieces of information. First, they must know the weight of the object, in terms of either kilograms or pounds. Next, they need to determine the volume displaced by the object, in terms of either liters or cubic feet. Finally, they must know the specific fluid in which the object is immersed. For diving those fluids are either salt water or fresh water.

Once armed with the above pieces of information, the diver can readily calculate the buoyancy characteristics of an object by first calculating the weight of the displaced water, and then subtracting that weight from the weight of the object.

###### Buoyancy

To solve buoyancy problems, some information is required.

1. Object weight
1. Volume of water displaced by the object
1. Weight of displaced water

> Imperial
> $$
> Buoyancy = weightOfObject- [(cubicFeetDisplaced)(lbsPerCubicFootOfWater)]

> Metric

###### Lift Bags

Lift bags can be calculated with these formulae:

> Imperial
> $$
> ft^3airRequired = [lbs of negative buoyancy] / [lbs per cu ft of water]
> $$

> Metric
> $$
> litersOfAirRequired = [negativeBuoyancy] / [kgPerLiterOfWater]

### Boyle's Law

#### Pressure and Volume

Although Robert Boyle (1627-1692) was not the first to discover this finding he was the first to publish it and that is why it is known as Boyle's Law. This principle states that "Any change in pressure applied upon a fixed amount of gas at a constant temperature will result in a corresponding and inversely proportional change in the volume of that gas." In other words, if the pressure doubles, the volume will decrease by one-half; and if the pressure decreases by one-half, the volume will double.

Though perhaps not specifically recognized due to the state of science at that time, in practice Boyle's Law has since been extended to also encompass the density of a gas. In effect, changes in density are a sort of a by-product of the changes in pressure and volume. Gas is comprised of molecules; when confined within any container, the quantity of gas molecules remains constant. As pressure increases and volume decreases, these molecules are pushed closer together rendering the gas denser. As pressure decreases and volume increases, these molecules move farther apart rendering the gas less dense. The change in density is directly proportional to the change in pressure, and inversely proportional to the change in volume.

Below is a table many entry-level classes use to demonstrate Boyle's Law:

| Depth (sw) |        | Ambient Pressure | Volume | Density |
|------------|--------|------------------|--------|---------|
| 0 m        | 0 ft   | 1 bar/atm        | x 1    | x 1     |
| 10 m       | 33 ft  | 2 bar/atm        | x 1/2  | x 2     |
| 20 m       | 66 ft  | 3 bar/atm        | x 1/3  | x 3     |
| 30 m       | 99 ft  | 4 bar/atm        | x 1/4  | x 4     |
| 40 m       | 132 ft | 5 bar/atm        | x 1/5  | x 5     |
| 50 m       | 165 ft | 6 bar/atm        | x 1/6  | x 6     |

In reviewing the above table it is important to understand that, in all cases, the pressure of the gas inside a flexible container will be equal to the ambient pressure exerted upon the exterior of that container.

#### How this Principal Relates to Diving

The tissues of the human body are primarily liquid, and liquid is non-compressible; thus much of the body is unaffected by pressure. Within the body there are two significant air spaces: the lungs and the interconnected middle ears and nasal sinuses. In addition, a third air space is artificially created over the face and eyes by the diver's mask. These three air spaces are impacted by the pressure-related changes. During descent and ascent, each of these air spaces must be equalized to the ambient pressure in order to avoid discomfort and possible injury.

The most common type of exposure protection worn by sport divers is a neoprene wetsuit. Neoprene is a closed cell foam and relatively light in weight compared to the water it displaces, and therefore neoprene is quite buoyant and is compressible. Changes will be most apparent when the diver is wearing a relatively thick wetsuit. To maintain proper buoyancy control, the diver needs to add air to the BCD during descent, and vent air from the BCD during ascent. Other pieces of equipment that are impacted by Boyle's Law are the BCD and dry suit.

When air is inhaled from the cylinder by the diver, it enters the flexible air space of the respiratory system and immediately becomes subject to the pressure-related changes associated with Boyle's Law. The issues related to the inhaled air are three-fold.

Upon inhalation the pressure of the air inside a diver's lungs will be equal to the ambient pressure. If that diver happens to ascend to a shallower depth while holding his breath, the expanding volume of air inside the lungs can result in a lung rupture.

> It should be stressed that a diver should always breathe continuously, never holding his breath.

The second issue with air inhaled at depth relates to the diver's rate of air consumption. When that diver descends to 10 metres or 33 feet (where the ambient pressure is 2 bar / 2 atm), the diver will need to inhale twice as many molecules of air with each breath to fill the lungs. Therefore, the air will last only one-half as long at this depth as it would at the surface.

Air inhaled at depth becomes more dense. At 10 metres or 33 feet, the inhaled air will be twice as dense as it is at the surface, and its density further increases at deeper depths.

The denser air itself generally creates no noticeable problem for a diver within traditional sport diving depths, provided that the diver continues breathing at a normal rate. However, in the event of overexertion the diver's breathing rate will quicken and, when combined with the increased density of inhaled air, may result in turbulence as the air passes down the diver's airway towards the lungs. When turbulence occurs, the diver will likely sense some degree of difficulty in breathing. It is stressed during training that divers always should move slowly and steadily underwater, avoiding overexertion.

#### The Significance of Relative Changes

Ambient pressure increases by 1 bar for every 10 metres of depth, or by 1 atm for every 33 feet of depth, in seawater. This information seems to suggest that changes in pressure, volume, and density always are uniform over various depths, regardless of the depths involved.

The ambient pressure doubles when the diver descends from the surface to 10 metres or 33 feet (which is an actual change of only one 1 bar / 1 atm), but ambient pressure does not double again until the diver descends from 10 metres or 33 feet to a new depth of 30 metres or 99 feet (which is now an actual change of 2 bar / 2 atm).

As another example, volume increases by only 25% during an ascent from a starting depth of 40 metres or 132 feet to a new depth of 30 metres or 99 feet (which is an actual change of 1 bar / 1 atm), yet volume increases by 100% during an ascent from 10 metres or 33 feet to the surface (which also is an actual change of only 1 bar / 1 atm).

The greatest relative changes occur at shallower depths. This emphasizes the importance of a diver equalizing early during a descent. It helps explain why a new diver may have more difficulty in effectively controlling buoyancy at shallower depths and why he might unexpectedly pop to the surface. It demonstrates the need for vigilance in maintaining a slow rate of ascent throughout the entire ascent, especially as the diver nears the surface.

#### Pressure and Volume Calculations

The following abbreviations appear within the formulas in this section:

- "P" for pressure
- "V" for volume
- subscript "1" for a starting value
- subscript "2" for an ending value

*Note*: The formulas for converting depth to ambient pressure, and ambient pressure to depth, are addressed in the preceding section on pressure. They must also be in a flexible container; these formulae do not work with rigid bodies.

Boyle's Law is depicted mathematically by the following formula for both Imperial and metric measurements:

$$
(P_1)(V_1)=(P_2)(V_2)
$$

A diver's rate of air consumption directly corresponds to pressure-related changes in gas volume. If a diver knows the amount of time that a certain supply of gas will last at a given depth, he can readily calculate the time at a new depth with the following formula:

$$
min_2 = \frac{(P_1)(min_1)}{P_2}
$$

If a diver knows the amount of time that a supply of gas will last at a given depth, and he wants to determine the depth at which it will last for some specific period of time, the following formula applies:

$$
P_2= \frac{(P_1)(min_1)}{min_2}
$$

To determine the relative change in ambient pressure, such as that occurring between two different depths, the following formula may be employed:

$$
change_r=\frac{P_2}{P_1}
$$

Identifying changes in gas density actually requires no further calculation, as this change will be exactly the same as any relative change in ambient pressure; that is, if the pressure is doubled, then the density will also be doubled.

### Charles' Law and Gay-Lussac's Law

Jacques Alexandre Cesar Charles (1746-1823) studied the interrelationship of temperature and volume, and discovered the principle of physics that is now known as Charles' Law: " At a constant pressure, the volume of a gas increases or decreases by the same factor as its temperature." If the temperature goes up, then the volume also goes up, and this change is mathematically predicable.

#### Formulae for Temperature and Volume (Charles' Law)

These laws were proposed by JAC Charles.

T(up) = V(up) and T(down) = V(down)

$$
T(up)=V(up)
$$

$$
T(down)=V(down)
$$

#### Temperature and Pressure (Gay-Lussac's Law)

Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac (1778-1850) further advanced the work of Charles. In particular Gay-Lussac addressed the interrelationship between temperature and pressure, and discovered the principle now known in physics as Gay-Lussac's Law: "At a constant volume, the pressure of a gas increases or decreases by the same factor as its temperature." If the temperature goes up, then the pressure also goes up, and this change is mathematically predicable.

#### Concepts for Temperature and Pressure

*Note*: These aren't "formulae" per se; they map a relationship non-mathematically.

$$
T(up)=P(up)
$$

$$
T(down)=P(down)
$$

This new principle sounds quite similar to Charles' Law. While both deal with the effect of changing temperature, here the focus is on pressure rather than volume.

### How These Principals Relate to Diving

Changing temperature may be of little concern in certain tropical environments, where a diver encounters little or no difference between the temperature of seawater at the surface and at depth.

*Note*: This isn't a "formula" per se; it maps a relationship non-mathematically.

$$
T=V\&P
$$

In deeper technical diving, or in more temperate environments and especially in some freshwater lakes, the difference in water temperature can be more pronounced.

> Achieving neutral buoyancy in cold water with a BCD or lift bag still requires exactly the same volume of air as in warm water; but in cold water it will take more molecules of air, drawn from the scuba cylinder, to produce that same volume of air.

Perhaps the most obvious impact of changing temperature involves the scuba cylinder itself. An increase in temperature results in an increase in pressure inside the cylinder, and a decrease in temperature results in a decrease in pressure. When a scuba cylinder is left in the trunk of an automobile on a hot summer day, the pressure rises inside that cylinder (sometimes dangerously so); and when a warm cylinder is immersed in cool water, the diver might readily detect a drop of perhaps 5 to 10 bar, or 100 to 200 psi, in the cylinder's internal pressure as displayed by the SPG. This is why when teaching a specialty course, it is best to advise the students to remove the cylinders from a hot car and place them in the shade or cooler area. Should the cylinder pressure increase too much, the burst disc will rupture and the cylinder will be inoperable.

*Note*: This describes the phenomenon of a "hot fill." When gas is pumped into a pressurized container, its temperature increases. That's why fill stations may fill a 3000psi tank to 3100psi. The tank will be hot to the touch and, as it cools, will dip to 3000psi.

### Temperature and Volume Calculations (Charles' Law)

The following abbreviations appear within the formulas in this section:

- "T" for temperature
- "V" for volume
- "°C" for degrees Celsius (or Centigrade)
- "°F" for degrees Fahrenheit
- subscript "1" for a starting value
- subscript "2" for an ending value

Charles' Law is depicted mathematically by the following formula for both metric and Imperial:

$$
\frac{V_1}{T_1}=\frac{V_2}{T_2}
$$

Again, the components within this formula may be algebraically rearranged as needed. For instance, to find the new volume following any change in temperature, the following will apply:

$$
V_2=\frac{(T_2)(V_1)}{T_1}
$$

It is essential to note that the accuracy of this formula depends upon the above temperature values being expressed in terms of either degrees Kelvin or degrees Rankine. Kelvin and Rankine are temperature scales routinely used within the scientific community. The Kelvin scale is based upon the more common Celsius (or Centigrade) scale and a degree of Kelvin identifies the same unit of measurement for temperature as a degree of Celsius. 0° Kelvin is equal to -273° Celsius. To convert from Celsius to Kelvin, simply add 273 degrees.

$$
°K=°C+273
$$

The Rankine scale is based upon the Fahrenheit scale, and a degree of Rankine identifies the same unit of measurement for temperature as a degree of Fahrenheit. 0° Rankine is equal to -460° Fahrenheit. To convert from Fahrenheit to Rankine simply add 460 degrees.

$$
°R=°F+460
$$

When the additional Kelvin or Rankine calculations are incorporated into the above formula, they appear as follows:

$$
V_2=(°C_2+273)(\frac{V_1}{°C_1+273})
$$

$$
V_2=(°F_2+460)(\frac{V_1}{°F_1+460})
$$

### Temperature and Pressure Calculations (Gay-Lussac's Law)

The following abbreviations appear within the formulas in this section:

- "T" for temperature
- "V" for volume
- "°C" for degrees Celsius (or Centigrade)
- "°F" for degrees Fahrenheit
- subscript "1" for a starting value
- subscript "2" for an ending value

Gay-Lussac's Law is depicted mathematically by the following formula for metric and Imperial:

$$
\frac{P_1}{T_1}=\frac{P_2}{T_2}
$$

The components within this formula may be algebraically manipulated as needed; for instance, to find the new pressure following any change in temperature, the following will apply:

$$
P_2=\frac{(T_2)(P_1)}{T_1}
$$

Here too it is necessary to convert temperature values to Kelvin or Rankine. As usual, pressure refers to absolute (total) pressure; here it includes gauge pressure (internal pressure, as measured by an SPG-type device) plus atmospheric pressure. To convert gauge pressure to absolute pressure, just add 1 bar or 14.7 psi. Of course, 1 bar / 14.7 psi also must be subtracted again later in the calculations, to arrive back ultimately at gauge pressure. With these additional calculations incorporated into the formula, it would now appear as follows:

$$
Bar_2 = \frac{(°C_2+273)(Bar_1+1bar)}{°C_1+273}-1bar
$$

$$
Atm_2= \frac{(°F_2+460)(Atm_1+14.7psi)}{°F_1+460}-14.7psi
$$

#### Estimating Temperature and Pressure

As an alternative, in the real world of diving the effect of temperature upon pressure also may be quickly estimated. A change of 1°C will result in an approximate change of 0.6 bar. A change of 1°F will result in an approximate change of 5 psi. In either case, an increase in temperature will be accompanied by an increase in pressure, and a decrease in temperature will be accompanied by a decrease in pressure. These approximations are depicted as follows:

$$
1°C\approx0.6 bar
$$

$$
1°F\approx5 psi
$$

### Combined and Ideal Gas Laws

#### Pressure, Volume and Temperature (Combined Gas Law)

In the real world, multiple variables may come into play in a given situation, volume can be affected simultaneously by both changing pressure and changing temperature; pressure can be affected simultaneously by both changing volume and changing temperature; and temperature can be affected simultaneously by both changing pressure and changing volume.

To effectively address the possible combinations of pressure-volume-temperature variables all at the same time, physicists have adopted the concept of a Combined Gas Law. The Combined Gas Law is a mathematical combination of Boyle's Law, Charles' Law, and Gay-Lussac's Law as depicted by the following formula.

$$
\frac{(P_1)(V_1)}{T_1}=\frac{(P_2)(V_2)}{T_2}
$$

Within this formula pressure refers to absolute pressure and temperature refers to absolute temperature. This formula may also be rearranged as appropriate for the circumstances. It is noted, though, that once all the rearrangements and inherent conversions are applied to this equation, it can become rather unwieldy for all except the skilled mathematician. This formula is included here primarily for informational purposes rather than actual use.

For the sake of simplicity, the OWSDI might find it easier, when multiple variables are involved, to address those variables one at a time.

On occasion the reader may encounter some reference to a less formal "general gas law" that essentially incorporates the same concepts as the Combined Gas Law; though perhaps not technically accurate, in practice these two terms are sometimes used interchangeably.

#### Pressure, Volume, Temperature and Mass (Ideal Gas Law)

The Ideal Gas Law is a distinctly expanded concept beyond the Combined Gas Law. In addition to mathematical pressure-volume-temperature relationships, it incorporates values relating to the number of moles (representing molecules and other atomic and subatomic particles) that constitute a hypothetical ideal gas. The Ideal Gas Law is based upon the hypothesis that the volume of two theoretical "ideal"gases under the same pressure and at the same temperature will have similar mass. It is expressed by the following formula (where "n" is the number of moles, and "R" is a universal gas constant).

$$
pV=nRT
$$

It is noted, however, that the Ideal Gas Law neglects molecular structure and kinetics, which also govern the volume and mass of a gas. Therefore not all gases behave like an "ideal" gas and, in fact, an actual gas might differ significantly from the cited theoretical model. While the Ideal Gas Law certainly has some application within the scientific community, the inherent complexity and variability of this concept far outweigh its practical value within the context of diving. The Ideal Gas Law is included here primarily so that the reader will be able to distinguish it from, and not confuse it with, the Combined Gas Law.

## Partial Pressure (Dalton's Law)

John Dalton (1766-1844) studied the behavior of individual gases within a gas mixture and discovered the principle now known in physics as Dalton's Law. This principle states that "The total pressure exerted by a mixture of gases is equal to the sum of the pressures of each of its component gases, with each component gas acting as if it alone were present and occupied the total volume." In other words, each gas within a mixture has its own pressure and each gas is unaffected by any other gas in the mixture. Air is a mixture of gases containing approximately 21% oxygen and 79% nitrogen. Accordingly, oxygen accounts for 21% of the total pressure of air, and nitrogen accounts for 79% of the total pressure of air. This relationship of ambient (total) pressure and individual partial pressures is depicted in the following table:

| Depth (sw) | Depth (sw) | Ambient Pressure | Partial Pressure O2 | Partial Pressure N |
|------------|------------|------------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| 0 m        | 0 ft       | 1 bar/atm        | .21 bar/atm         | .79 bar/atm        |
| 10 m       | 33 ft      | 2 bar/atm        | .42 bar/atm         | 1.58 bar/atm       |
| 20 m       | 66 ft      | 3 bar/atm        | .63 bar/atm         | 2.37 bar/atm       |
| 30 m       | 99 ft      | 4 bar/atm        | .84 bar/atm         | 3.16 bar/atm       |
| 40 m       | 132 ft     | 5 bar/atm        | 1.05 bar/atm        | 3.95 bar/atm       |
| 50 m       | 165 ft     | 6 bar/atm        | 1.26 bar/atm        | 4.74 bar/atm       |

A prior discussion of Boyle's Law stated that the pressure of a gas inside a flexible container is equal to ambient pressure. Such also is true when considering partial pressure. As demonstrated in the above table, within a flexible container the percentages of oxygen and nitrogen remain constant in the air mixture, while the partial pressure of each gas varies proportionately with depth.

### How This Principle Relates to Diving

Dalton's Law provides the means to examine each of the components within air or any other gas mixture on an individual basis. As demonstrated in the previous table, when a diver is breathing air at a depth of 40 meters or 132 feet, the partial pressure of oxygen is about 21% of the total ambient pressure at that depth (5 bar x 0.21 = 1.05 bar / 1.05 atm) is roughly equivalent to a person breathing 100% oxygen at the surface (where the partial pressure of 100% oxygen would be 1 bar / 1 atm). When breathing air at 40 meters or 132 feet, the partial pressure of nitrogen (3.95 bar / 3.95 atm) is almost five times the "dose" of nitrogen a person would breathe on the surface. This helps explain, at least in part, why a diver's body absorbs additional nitrogen at depth. In fact, it is the partial pressure of a gas that determines its physiological impact. The actual percentage of a gas within any mixture is largely immaterial except as it relates to partial pressure.

The following table depicts the partial pressures of oxygen and nitrogen in air, and also those in a nitrox mixture containing 40% oxygen:

| Depth (sw) | Depth (sw) | Ambient Pressure | PPO2 (air)  | PPN (air)    | PPO2 40%EANx | PPN 40%EANx  |
|------------|------------|------------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| 0 m        | 0 ft       | 1 bar/atm        | .21 bar/atm | .79 bar/atm  | .40 bar/atm  | .60 bar/atm  |
| 10 m       | 33 ft      | 2 bar/atm        | .42 bar/atm | 1.58 bar/atm | .80 bar/atm  | 1.20 bar/atm |
| 20 m       | 66 ft      | 3 bar/atm        | .63 bar/atm | 2.37 bar/atm | 1.20 bar/atm | 1.80 bar/atm |
| 30 m       | 99 ft      | 4 bar/atm        | .84 bar/atm | 3.16 bar/atm | 1.60 bar/atm | 2.40 bar/atm |

### Partial Pressure Calculations

The following abbreviations appear within the formulas in this section:

- "P" for pressure (ambient pressure)
- "PO2" for partial pressure of oxygen
- "PN2" for partial pressure of nitrogen
- "FO2" for fraction of oxygen (such as, 21% = 0.21)
- "FN2" for fraction of nitrogen (such as, 79% = 0.79)
- "D" for depth
- "EAD" for equivalent air depth

*Note*: The formulas for converting depth to ambient pressure and ambient pressure to depth are addressed in the earlier section on pressure.

To determine the partial pressure of a component gas in any gas mixture, simply multiply the ambient pressure by the fraction of that gas. In the case of air, the partial pressures of oxygen and nitrogen may be calculated with the following formulae:

$$
PO_2=(P)(FO_2)
$$

$$
PN_2=(P)(FN_2)
$$

As before, the component factors within this formula may be algebraically rearranged as needed. For example, if a diver wants to determine which nitrox mixture provides a specified partial pressure of either oxygen or nitrogen at a given ambient pressure, the following formulas would apply:

$$
FO_2=\frac{PO_2}{P}
$$

$$
FN_2=\frac{PN_2}{P}
$$

Several of the previous formulas can be used in succession to determine equivalent air depth. Alternatively, all of these calculations may be combined into a single equivalent air depth formula, as depicted below:

#### Metric

$$
EAD=((\frac{FN_2}{0.79})(D+10))-10
$$

*Note*: This second formula is just algebraic manipulation that makes more sense to me. --jcb

$$
EAD=\frac{(FN_2)(D+10)}{0.79}-10
$$

#### Imperial

$$
EAD=((\frac{FN_2}{0.79})(D+33))-33
$$

*Note*: This second formula is just algebraic manipulation that makes more sense to me. --jcb

$$
EAD=\frac{(FN_2)(D+33)}{0.79}-33
$$

## Henry's Law (Partial Pressure and Gas Solubility")

William Henry (1775-1836) discovered the principle now known as Henry's Law. This principle states that, "At a constant temperature, the quantity of a gas which is dissolved in a given type and volume of liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of that gas in equilibrium with that liquid."

> When pressure is exerted by a gas upon a liquid, some amount of gas will move into solution within that liquid. It should be noted that, once dissolved, gas continues to exert pressure; here this force is more commonly referred to as tension.

As additional gas enters into solution, it contributes to the overall tension of that gas within the liquid. As cited within the context of this principle, the term "in equilibrium" refers to that point at which partial pressure and tension are equal, and the transition of gas ceases.

Despite the variability related to solubility coefficients, Henry's Law nevertheless dictates that when the partial pressure is doubled, the quantity of gas that can now be dissolved into the liquid is also doubled.

| Partial Pressure of Gas | Maximum Quantity of Dissolved Gas |
|:-----------------------:|:---------------------------------:|
| 0.25 bar/atm            | x .25                             |
| 0.50 bar/atm            | x 0.50                            |
| 0.75 bar/atm            | x 0.75                            |
| 1 bar/atm               | x 1                               |
| 2 bar/atm               | x 2                               |
| 3 bar/atm               | x 3                               |
| 4 bar/atm               | x 4                               |
| 5 bar/atm               | x 5                               |

It is also important to note that when the pressure gradient reverses, the liquid is now supersaturated with gas.

### How this Principle Relates to Diving

Earlier it was noted that the body's tissues are primarily liquid in nature, and therefore unaffected by those factors associated with Boyle's Law. Dalton's Law laid the foundation that the physiological impact of a gas is tied to its partial pressure. Henry's Law correlates partial pressure with the solubility of gases in the body's tissues. These three laws are the principal laws that explain: DCS, nitrogen narcosis, arterial gas embolisms and gas expansion or contraction as they relate to temperature.

### Haldane's Decompression Model

#### Theoretical Tissue Compartments

John Scott Haldane (1860-1936) constructed a mathematical model involving multiple theoretical tissue compartments. Each compartment was defined by certain properties. Though these compartments did not directly correspond to actual tissues, Haldane hypothesized that taken together these compartments would mimic the overall behavior of a diver's body in regards to the nitrogen on-gassing and off-gassing processes.

#### Half-Times

Haldane assigned a half-time to each theoretical tissue compartment, as the rate at which it would both absorb and release nitrogen. A half-time is the time, in minutes, for a compartment to go halfway from its initial level of dissolved nitrogen at a certain depth, to its ultimate level of dissolved nitrogen at a new depth. This exponential rate of on-gassing and off-gassing is demonstrated in the accompanying tables.

<table><thead><tr><th colspan="2">60 Minute Compartment Exposed to Increased Pressure</th><th colspan="2">5 Minute Compartment Exposed to Decreased Pressure</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Elapsed Time</td><td>On-Gassing Completed</td><td>Elapsed Time</td><td>Off-Gassing Completed</td></tr><tr><td>Start</td><td>0.0%</td><td>Start</td><td>0.0%</td></tr><tr><td>1 hour</td><td>50.0%</td><td>5 minutes</td><td>50.0%</td></tr><tr><td>2 hours</td><td>75.0%</td><td>10 minutes</td><td>75.0%</td></tr><tr><td>3 hours</td><td>87.5%</td><td>15 minutes</td><td>87.5%</td></tr><tr><td>4 hours</td><td>93.8%</td><td>20 minutes</td><td>93.8%</td></tr><tr><td>5 hours</td><td>96.9%</td><td>25 minutes</td><td>96.9%</td></tr><tr><td>6 hours</td><td>98.5%</td><td>30 minutes</td><td>98.5%</td></tr></tbody></table>

#### M-Values

Haldane conducted various experiments to determine the maximum quantity of excess nitrogen that could be held in solution by each theoretical tissue compartment during an ascent, following time at depth, with a pre-defined rate of ascent. Haldane initially conducted his experiments with goats, and then conducted further experiments with human volunteers, including himself, involving both pressurized chambers and actual open water dives. Through trial and error research he eventually identified the maximum limits for excess nitrogen. This type of limit is now known as an M-value and most often is expressed as a factor, or percentage, above the normal quantity of nitrogen present in a saturated tissue at the surface.

#### Haldane's Algorithm

Haldane combined all of this information into a complex mathematical computation, or algorithm. In doing so he calculated the relevant information for each theoretical tissue compartment and found that, depending upon the circumstances of a particular dive, different compartments would effectively govern the time limits at different depths. From these calculations he projected a schedule of depths and times that constituted the first dive tables, which then saw widespread use by the Royal Navy and others from 1907 to 1956. While his work was highly theoretical in nature, time has largely proven Haldane's methodology to be valid.

#### Modern Dive Tables and Dive Computers

Haldane's decompression model provided the essential parameters for subsequent research and refinement. Over the years researchers have continued to build upon Haldane's original efforts, typically expanding the number of theoretical tissue compartments within the mathematical model, recalculating applicable M-values, altering specified ascent rates, assigning dissimilar rates for the on-gassing and off-gassing processes, and/or otherwise modifying the algorithm in some manner. Professor Albert Buhlmann's work with decompression theory during the latter part of the last century has been particularly useful to scuba divers. Today most dive tables and personal dive computers rely upon an algorithm derived from Haldane's original decompression model.

 Current decompression algorithms, such as dual-phase or bubble-models, are even more complex than that developed by Haldane and refined over a century of studied application. This complexity clearly precludes any attempt at impromptu decompression calculations. The diver should always rely upon published dive tables and/or a Personal Dive Computer for accurate decompression-related information.

### Summary: Chapter 5, 6 and 7

 This chapter was a recap of physics that relate to scuba diving. How these theories apply to scuba diving was also reviewed. It was not intended to be comprehensive but rather to refresh the theory learned in the divemaster course. For a more comprehensive review of physics refer to the SDI Divemaster Manual.

## Diving Physiology

Physiology is another key component in the overall body of knowledge a dive professional is expected to possess. We will review the key components and overall body of knowledge that was learned during the SDI Divemaster course. As the OWSDI candidate reviews this information, if they come across a subject that needs more elaboration, they should refer back to the SDI Divemaster manual for a more in-depth discussion. The dive professional should be well versed in all the subjects covered in this chapter. Although most divers will never experience these maladies it is important for the instructor to know how to recognize and address them.

### Pulmonary System

The role of the pulmonary system is the exchange of gases, with certain gases being introduced into the body while other gases are eliminated, the two primary gasses being oxygen and carbon dioxide. Oxygen is a critical ingredient in the body's metabolic process; in a normal environment, air contains 21% oxygen, which is introduced to the body with each inhaled breath. Carbon dioxide is a by-product of metabolism, and at elevated levels it is potentially harmful to the body. Carbon dioxide is expelled from the body with each exhaled breath. Carbon dioxide is also what triggers the receptors in the body to breathe.

Inhalation is controlled primarily by the muscles of the diaphragm. When these muscles contract, the ribcage expands and the contents of the abdomen are moved downward, resulting in increased volume and decreased pressure within the lungs. When more active inhalation is required, other deeper muscles within the chest and neck will supplement the muscles of the diaphragm. Restful exhalation is generally a passive process. As the diaphragm muscles relax following inhalation, the elastic tissues of the lungs recoil and thereby gently push air out of the lungs. More active exhalation requires muscles within the abdomen and chest to contract more quickly, decreasing the volume and increasing pressure within the lungs, moving air more quickly and forcefully out of the lungs

The movement of oxygen from the lungs through the alveoli into the blood and then to the tissues is the direct result of its partial pressure. The movement of carbon dioxide from the tissues into the blood and through the alveoli into the lungs also is the direct result of its partial pressure. Remember, gas always moves from an area of higher pressure and density to an area of lower pressure and density.

> Rather than directly sensing the body's need for oxygen, the breathing reflex is primarily triggered by the buildup of carbon dioxide in the blood.

When additional physical demands are placed upon the body, such as strenuous physical activity, the metabolic rate increases; this also raises the output of carbon dioxide, and thereby the breathing rate quickens. When the breathing reflex is intentionally overridden by an individual deliberately holding his breath, the increasing level of carbon dioxide eventually results in a neurosignal to other parts of the brain triggering a conscious urge to breathe.

### Cardiovascular System

As a review, the role of the body's circulatory system is the movement of gases, nutrients and wastes throughout the body. The circulatory system actually consists of two separate and distinct sub-systems: the cardiovascular system and the lymphatic system. For the purposes of this review, we will focus primarily on the cardiovascular system and more specifically how it transports gasses. The four parts that make up the cardio-vascular system are: the heart, arteries, veins and capillaries.

Hemoglobin is the specific component within the blood to which both oxygen and carbon dioxide attach, while being transported by the blood throughout the body.

Starting with pulmonary circulation at the heart, the blood enters and gathers within the right atrium of the heart. An initial contraction of the upper heart muscle moves the blood from the right atrium downward into the right ventricle of the heart. A subsequent contraction of the lower heart muscle then moves the blood from the right ventricle through the pulmonary arteries to those capillaries that surround the alveoli of the lungs. Here carbon dioxide passes from the blood through the permeable membrane of the alveoli and into the lungs, while oxygen passes in the opposite direction from the lungs and into the blood. The oxygen-rich blood then returns to the heart through the pulmonary veins, and now enters the left atrium of the heart. HeartThe initial contraction of the upper heart muscle moves the blood from the left atrium downward into the left ventricle, and the subsequent contraction of the lower heart muscle then moves the blood from the left ventricle into the aorta, which is the body's largest systemic artery. From the aorta the blood branches out into the series of smaller systemic arteries leading to capillaries located throughout the tissues.

Here oxygen passes from the blood to the tissues, where it is used in the body's metabolic process; and also here carbon dioxide, which is a by-product of metabolism, passes from the tissues to the blood. The oxygen-poor blood returns through the systemic veins towards the heart, where it then re-enters the right atrium of the heart and transitions again into pulmonary circulation.

### Decompression Illness

#### What Is DCI?

Decompression illness, or DCI, is the diagnostic classification for the conditions that a diver may suffer upon ascent to the surface following any time at depth, as the direct result of decompression. More specifically, DCI includes both decompression sickness and arterial gas embolism. The mechanism leading to each of these conditions are distinctly different; nevertheless, each is remarkably similar, making it impossible at times to distinguish between the two. Both conditions are treated exactly the same way in terms of emergency first aid at the scene and follow-up medical care.

#### Decompression Sickness

Decompression sickness, or DCS (sometimes also referred to as "the bends"), is caused by the formation of nitrogen bubbles within the tissues of a diver's body. Nitrogen is physiologically inert and does not chemically interact with the tissues. A certain amount of nitrogen will be dissolved within the tissues simply because the body is exposed to it. Similar to the movement of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the preceding discussion, nitrogen moves from the lungs through the blood to the tissues and from the tissues through the blood to the lungs, based upon its partial pressure.

Bubbles can form when a diver makes a direct ascent to the surface after remaining too long at a given depth, due to an excessive pressure gradient. Bubbles can also form when a diver makes a rapid ascent from any depth, even while otherwise adhering to established depth and time limits.

DCS is normally associated with bubble formation in the tissues, but it is important to recognize that nitrogen bubbles can also form in the blood. This usually occurs at the same time and for exactly the same reasons. In fact, unlike the tissues, the extent of bubble formation in the blood can be accurately measured through the use of an electronic Doppler stethoscope.

Divers routinely rely upon dive tables and personal dive computers to effectively manage their exposure to excess nitrogen, and thereby minimize their risk of DCS.

> It's important to point out, however, that no table or computer can guarantee a completely risk-free dive in terms of DCS.

A number of physiological factors might increase the susceptibility of an individual diver to DCS, even if they adhere to the depth-time profiles specified by that diver's tables or computer. These factors can include:

- Older Age
- Obesity
- Poor Fitness
- Recent Injury or Illness
- Cold Conditions
- Excessive Workload
- Fatigue
- Dehydration
- Prior Occurrence of DCS

A diver can minimize some of these factors by ensuring proper fitness and health, staying properly hydrated, using appropriate thermal exposure protection, and avoiding over-exertion. Sport divers can minimize the risk of DCS by:

- Diving conservatively
- Avoiding diving up to the no-decompression limits specified by their tables or computer
- Adhering to the maximum ascent rate indicated by their dive tables or computer.
- Ascend at a slow rate
- Completing a safety stop of 3 to 5 minutes during ascent at a depth of 3 to 6 metres or 10 to 20 feet

Remember, when a repetitive dive is made prior to completion of the off-gassing process, residual nitrogen will remain in the diver's tissues and it becomes an additional factor in determining the applicable depth-time limits for the repetitive dive.

DCS can occur if the diver is subjected to a subsequent decrease in ambient pressure, as will be encountered when traveling to a higher altitude or flying in a plane. Accordingly, DAN (Divers Alert Network) currently recommends the following minimum surface intervals before flying: 12 hours after a single dive; 18 hours after multiple dives or multiple days of diving; and 24 hours after any dive requiring staged or emergency decompression. SDI Divers, because they are required to use personal dive computers, should follow the recommendation of their dive computer as to when it is safe to fly.

The severity of DCS will depend upon the extent, as well as the location where the bubbles may form. In terms of significance, DCS is often characterized by type: Type I involves skin rash, itching, and localized pain; Type II involves the central nervous system, respiratory system, and/or circulatory system.

> The early onset of DCS can be rather subtle, and thus it might be initially overlooked or discounted by the diver.

The signs and symptoms of DCS usually begin to appear within 15 minutes to 2 hours after surfacing, but onset can be delayed for up to 24 hours. Once onset occurs, signs and symptoms may worsen over time, and Type I can transition to Type II. Signs and symptoms do not normally subside on their own, and left untreated DCS can cause long-term neurological complications. Early intervention, in regards to both first aid at the scene and subsequent professional medical care, greatly increases an affected diver's chance of a full recovery.

Arterial gas embolism, or AGE, occurs when a gas bubble blocks the arterial flow of blood to a vital organ. It might arise in DCS, when nitrogen comes out of solution and forms nitrogen bubbles within the blood. More often it occurs when over-pressurized air still in its gaseous state passes through the alveoli and enters the bloodstream as an air bubble.

Perhaps the most obvious potential cause of AGE is when a diver holds his breath, which may occur during a panicked ascent following some underwater complication. Another possible cause is lung congestion, as can occur with certain illnesses and allergies where the congestive fluids actually entrap some amount of air within the recesses of the lungs. Asthma-like restriction of the pulmonary airway can also be a possible cause. An excessively rapid ascent, which simply surpasses the equalization process of normal respiration, is another possible cause.

Over-pressurization within the lungs can have two consequences. It may cause a rupture of the lung tissue with air then escaping into the chest cavity or it can force a bubble of air to pass through the alveoli and enter the blood, leading to arterial gas embolism.

Once in the bloodstream the bubble passes into systemic circulation and travels through the progressively narrowing network of arteries towards the capillaries. Meanwhile, additional decrease in ambient pressure (due to a continuing ascent) will cause that bubble to expand in size. Eventually, the bubble will become lodged in an artery, blocking the flow of blood beyond that point. A blockage can occur anywhere throughout the body, but of course the greatest risk occurs when that blockage impacts a vital organ.

> When an arterial blockage occurs in the brain, it will produce a sudden stroke; a stroke will manifest in other bodily dysfunction such as weakness or paralysis, respiratory distress or cardiac arrest.

If the blockage occurs in one of the arteries supplying oxygen to the heart, it can also directly result in cardiac arrest.

>A diver may employ a few simple precautions to avoid the risk of AGE – never hold one’s breath, seek medical advice for any question regarding the overall health of the respiratory system, postpone diving while temporarily congested and always ascend slowly.

The severity of signs and symptoms will depend upon the location of the arterial blockage. Though its signs and symptoms may be quite similar to those of DCS, the onset of AGE is often more rapid and dramatic. Sudden unconsciousness may occur immediately upon surfacing, or even during the ascent. In addition, because of the risk to vital organs, AGE can be more immediately life-threatening.

#### DCI and Patent Foramen Ovale

Patent Foramen Ovale, or PFO, is a circulatory defect and is believed to be a possible predisposing factor for the onset of DCI.

The foramen ovale is a flap-like valve within the heart. This valve is open during fetal development, and then closes after birth. When the foramen ovale is open it connects the right atrium to the left atrium, thereby shunting blood into systemic circulation while by-passing pulmonary circulation. The foramen ovale closes after birth, when the newborn begins to breathe on its own, and thereby establishes pulmonary circulation and segregates it from systemic circulation. PFO can be identified through special testing procedures, but such is not a part of routine medical screening, and in many cases PFO simply goes undetected. Statistical evidence suggests that it might create an increased risk of DCS or DCI during scuba diving activities.

#### Signs and Symptoms of DCI

A sign is an outward indication that can be readily observed by another person, while a symptom is an internal indication that is sensed by the patient. Following is a list of common signs and symptoms of DCI:

- Skin rash or itching
- Tingling or numbness
- Joint or limb pain
- Back, abdominal, or chest pain or discomfort
- Unusual headache
- Extreme fatigue
- Weakness or paralysis
- Dizziness, loss of balance, or loss of coordination
- Confusion or disorientation
- Unresponsiveness or unconsciousness
- Convulsions
- Difficulty swallowing
- Slurred speech
- Hearing disturbance
- Visual disturbance
- Loss of bladder or bowel control
- Difficulty urinating with a full bladder
- Unusual coughing
- Rapid, shallow, or distressed breathing
- Blood or froth in the mouth
- Rapid, erratic, or weak pulse
- Cardiac arrest

#### First Aid for Suspected DCI

The primary and immediate patient care always focuses upon the ABCs:

- Airway (open)
- Breathing (present)
- Circulation (present)

Once the ABCs have been confirmed, the following first aid procedures should be implemented whenever DCI is suspected:

- Activate EMS (emergency medical services), or seek medical care
- Administer 100% oxygen (or highest percentage of oxygen available)
- Have the victim lie down in supine or recovery position
- Monitor the patient
- Treat for shock
- Administer CPR when appropriate

> In general DCI does not get better on its own. Left unattended, the signs and symptoms often worsen. Any delay in appropriate care increases the risk of long-term neurological complications. Prompt medical attention always is indicated.
Oxygen administration may:

- Help the diver off-gas excess nitrogen more quickly
- Reduce blood sludging (thickening)
- Reduce nitrogen bubble size
- Increase oxygenated blood flow
- Reduce tissue swelling
- Ease breathing
- Improve the chances of a full recovery

To be most effective, the patient should be administered the highest possible concentration of oxygen. In the event that the available oxygen is depleted, a technical diver's decompression gas (with its high content of oxygen) can sometimes be substituted, provided the patient can tolerate breathing through a traditional scuba regulator. In the case of a non-breathing patient, the constant-flow system may be used with an oro-nasal resuscitation mask (sometimes referred to as a "pocket mask") to supplement rescue breaths delivered during CPR.

> In any case of suspected DCI, once signs or symptoms have been detected, the patient should always be evaluated by a qualified medical professional.

It is important to recognize, however, that there is no need to await the actual onset of DCI before administering oxygen. If a diver has been exposed to a distinct risk of DCI, oxygen may be administered immediately as a precautionary measure. In this case the early administration of oxygen may help to prevent the onset of DCI, or at least lessen its severity.

While administering oxygen, the patient should lie down. Sometimes a patient will resist out of embarrassment or, because of pain or discomfort, the patient might prefer an alternate position. In either case, the more important issue is getting the patient to breath oxygen, rather than the patient's position.

In any case of DCI, initially minor signs and symptoms may quickly and unexpectedly worsen. While awaiting professional medical care, the patient should be carefully monitored. During this time the patient should be kept as comfortable as possible. In regards to shock, the patient will also need to be kept warm. A conscious patient who is able to swallow may be given a non-caffeinated and non-carbonated beverage. While fluids will quench a thirst, more importantly they also help to maintain hydration, which will help to counteract some of the effects of shock and also reduce sludging of the blood.

#### Five-Minute Field Neurological Evaluation

To objectively assess the signs and symptoms in a suspected case of DCI, the dive leader may employ a relatively quick and simple field neurological evaluation. This procedure will be beneficial as part of the initial assessment of the patient; it should also be repeated periodically, perhaps every 15 or 30 minutes, while the patient is awaiting professional medical attention. The time of each evaluation should be noted and all observations should be carefully recorded; this information should then be relayed to EMS and/or the treating physician. In particular, the dive leader should be alert to the following:

- Field Exam SlatesAny deviations from the expected norm
- Any differences from one side of the body to the other
- Any changes over time

The five-minute field neurological evaluation consists of 12 steps, generally progressing from head to toe. Note any abnormality to the following.

- Orientation
- Eyes
- Forehead
- Face
- Ears
- Gag Reflex
- Tongue
- Shoulders
- Arms and Hands
- Chest
- Legs
- Heel-to-Toe Walk

Though beneficial in assessing the signs and symptoms of DCI, the five-minute field neurological evaluation should never take precedence over the patient’s primary care; rendering appropriate first aid always remains the priority.

#### Recompression Therapy

Recompression in a hyperbaric chamber is the standard treatment for DCI. The term "hyperbaric" literally means "high pressure;" thus a hyperbaric chamber is a high pressure chamber. The injured diver is placed inside the chamber and ambient pressure inside the chamber is increased, usually to a pressure of 3 to 6 bar / atm. After an appropriate amount of time the ambient pressure is then slowly decreased, usually in a series of stages or steps, until the diver is finally returned to surface-level ambient pressure.

Recompression therapy might quickly remove the bubble, but there still remains damage to the surrounding tissue. It takes time for the damaged tissues to heal and diving activities should be suspended during this healing process. The US Navy recommends that a diver remain out of the water for at least seven days following resolution of Type I DCS, while DAN recommends a minimum of two to four weeks following subsidence of any neurological signs and symptoms of Type II DCS. More significant cases may require an even longer period of healing. Before resuming diving activities, the injured diver should always be evaluated by a dive medicine physician.

Recompression therapy is most effective when it is initiated quickly after the onset of signs and symptoms. The dive leader should resist the temptation to immediately take an injured diver directly to the closest hyperbaric chamber because appropriate medical care may be lacking at that location. In addition, that chamber might be found to be already in use, un-staffed, or otherwise unavailable. Instead, it is recommended that the injured diver always be transported to the nearest medical facility for evaluation and treatment.Transport to Medical Facility

Despite the benefits of recompression, the dive leader should never attempt impromptu in-water recompression of an injured diver as the following may apply:

- May cause the diver to on-gas additional nitrogen.
- It is unlikely that a sufficient air supply will be available to complete the recompression process.
- There is the risk of hypothermia over time, even in relatively warm water, which can create further complications.
- Does not allow effective monitoring of the patient and rendering of first aid procedures.

> In all suspected cases of DCI the diver should remain out of the water, and should be administered oxygen and other appropriate first aid, while awaiting further medical care.

### Nitrogen Narcosis

Narcosis is the state of intoxication that can be caused by breathing a high concentration of inert gas, or a lower concentration of inert gas under elevated pressure. The phenomenon of narcosis is not completely understood, but it is believed to occur when an inert gas is absorbed into the membrane of nerve cells and begins to interfere with the electrical signals transmitted by those nerves. The extent of narcosis will vary from one inert gas to another, and will be dependent upon the partial pressure of a particular inert gas at a given point in time. Narcosis is not physiologically harmful; it poses a risk because of its adverse impact upon a diver's overall alertness and performance.

Nitrogen is the most common inert gas encountered by recreational divers and is the primary cause of narcosis in typical sport diving activities.

As a diver descends, the partial pressure of nitrogen increases within the diver's lungs. Its elevated partial pressure causes additional nitrogen to move from the lungs into the diver's body, where it can begin to interfere with the electrical signals transmitted by the nerves. Susceptibility to nitrogen narcosis varies from diver to diver and from day to day, but primarily it is dependent upon depth. The narcotic effect becomes increasingly pronounced at 30 meters or 100 feet, and a diver will exhibit outward signs of nitrogen narcosis. Deeper depths will produce even more severe symptoms.

Narcosis can cause:

- Sense of euphoria
- Lack of concern
- Paranoia
- Diminished coordination
- Impaired thinking
- Foolish behavior
- Hallucinations

The effects of nitrogen narcosis can intensify with physical or psychological stress.

Recent and cumulative deep diving experience appears to help counter, to some degree, the adverse effects of nitrogen narcosis.

> Ascending to a shallower depth eliminates the effects of narcosis.

Unlike DCI, nitrogen narcosis poses no lingering concern after surfacing, and requires no subsequent medical intervention.

### Inert Gas Narcosis

Other inert gases also are capable of inducing narcosis; the extent of narcosis related to a particular gas is dependent upon a number of factors including its molecular weight. Examples of inert gases would be helium and argon (commonly used as a dry suit gas).

Though oxygen is not an inert gas, it can behave like one at times. This may be encountered with the use of nitrox. At depth, the elevated partial pressure of oxygen may result in more of this gas entering the blood than can readily be used in the metabolic process; when this occurs, some of the excess oxygen will be deposited throughout the tissues including the membrane of nerve cells. Oxygen is similar in weight to nitrogen, and has similar narcotic properties. Therefore the overall effect of inert gas narcosis will be about the same, regardless of whether the diver is breathing nitrox or air, at any given depth.

### Gas Toxicity

Toxicity is the degree to which a particular substance is poisonous to the body. It may refer to the effect upon the body as a whole, as well as upon a specific tissue or process within the body.

Central to this review is the concept of a time-dose exposure. Time refers to the duration of exposure to a given gas, and dose refers to the level (or intensity) of exposure to that gas. The dose is determined by the partial pressure of the gas in question. Below a certain minimum toxic dose, a particular gas will not become toxic despite the duration of exposure; and above a certain maximum toxic dose, a particular gas can immediately become toxic. At intermediate dosage levels, the toxic effect will be cumulative in nature, and the degree of toxicity will be directly dependent upon the duration of exposure to the particular gas at its then current partial pressure.

#### Central Nervous System Oxygen Toxicity

Oxygen at significantly elevated partial pressures can become toxic. CNS (central nervous system) oxygen toxicity is one of two types of oxygen toxicity, and it is the one with which divers are more concerned. The most significant manifestation of CNS oxygen toxicity is convulsions. When convulsions occur underwater, it is likely the affected diver will lose their regulator and there is a distinct risk of drowning. There are, however, other signs and symptoms of CNS and they can be remembered by the acronym "ConVENTID."

- **Con**vulsions
- **V**isual disturbances
- **E**uphoria
- **N**ausea
- **T**innitus/tingling or twitching
- **I**rritability
- **D**izziness/dyspnea

In regards to CNS oxygen toxicity, NOAA has identified the maximum oxygen toxic dose to be a partial pressure of 1.6 bar or 1.6 atm for all diving activities. The accompanying table depicts further time dose relationships as established by NOAA.

| Oxygen Partial Pressure ( bar/ata)   | Single Dive Limit (minutes)   | Daily Limit (minutes)   |
|:----------------------------------:  |:---------------------------:  |:---------------------:  |
| 1.6                                  | 45                            | 150                     |

| 1.2                                  | 210                           | 240                     |
| 1.1                                  | 240                           | 270                     |
| 1.0                                  | 300                           | 300                     |
| 0.9                                  | 360                           | 360                     |
| 0.8                                  | 450                           | 450                     |
| 0.7                                  | 570                           | 570                     |
| 0.6                                  | 720                           | 720                     |

The primary factor regarding the onset of CNS oxygen toxicity is the diver's exposure to an elevated partial pressure of oxygen; it should be noted, however, that an elevated level of carbon dioxide within a diver's body may be an additional contributing factor.

If a diver begins to convulse underwater, the diver's buddy should immediately render assistance by taking physical control of the convulsing diver, and then start a controlled ascent to the surface. When the regulator is still in the convulsing diver's mouth, the buddy should attempt to hold it in place. If the regulator is already out of the affected diver's mouth, the buddy should not attempt to replace it. As active convulsions subside, a person will generally enter a sleep-like state prior to regaining consciousness. Once back on the surface and out of the water, the diver's airway, breathing and circulation should be monitored and appropriate first aid should be administered as indicated.

> In all cases the affected diver should seek medical attention due to the possibility of inhaled water (even if the regulator was not lost), which later may lead to near-drowning complications.

#### Pulmonary Oxygen Toxicity

Pulmonary oxygen toxicity is the second type of oxygen toxicity, and it is caused by long-term exposure to elevated partial pressures of oxygen. This form of oxygen toxicity is not normally associated with sport diving activities but can be a concern for commercial saturation divers and divers undergoing hyperbaric treatment.

#### Carbon Dioxide Toxicity

Carbon dioxide, or CO2 is a by-product of metabolism in animals, plants and other organisms, which is dispersed into the atmospheric air. It also is removed from the air and used by plants in photosynthesis. Carbon dioxide normally comprises only about 0.038% of air, and at this low level its presence is negligible in any inhaled breath.

Any elevated level of carbon dioxide in atmospheric air can be problematic in diving when that air is then used to fill a diver's scuba cylinder.

A greater problem stems from carbon dioxide produced by the body itself during the course of a dive. At elevated levels this self-produced carbon dioxide will be equally toxic to the body, and could result in loss of consciousness.

> An elevated level of carbon dioxide within the body frequently stems from excessive workload.

Factors such as strenuous activity, cold water, older age, and diminished health or fitness will place increased physical demands upon a diver, increasing the overall workload. Another factor often overlooked is the increased effort of breathing caused by an ill-performing regulator, especially at deeper depths.

An elevated level of carbon dioxide also can be caused by a diver's ineffective breathing pattern, such as shallow breathing or skip-breathing. These breathing patterns are something the OWSDI should monitor while teaching students. An elevated level of carbon dioxide can be a contributing factor in the onset of both decompression sickness and CNS oxygen toxicity.

The lesser symptoms of carbon dioxide toxicity generally begin to alleviate on their own, after the increased workload subsides and/or after the affected diver resumes breathing normal atmospheric air, though they can also linger for some period of time. In severe cases, especially those involving respiratory distress or unconsciousness, the affected individual should be monitored and oxygen and other appropriate first aid should be administered while awaiting further medical attention.

#### Carbon Monoxide Toxicity

Carbon MonoxideCarbon monoxide, or CO is a by-product of inefficient (incomplete) combustion of a carbon-based fuel. It enters the body as a contaminant in inhaled air. Carbon monoxide passes from the lungs into the blood, where it attaches far more readily to the hemoglobin than does oxygen; it also forms a chemical bond that is significantly stronger than the bond between hemoglobin and oxygen. The effects of toxicity are cumulative in nature, and even a very low-level exposure to carbon monoxide can produce a rapid accumulation in the blood. The end result is asphyxiation (oxygen starvation) throughout the body.

The tissues most susceptible to carbon monoxide toxicity are the heart and central nervous system. It may cause a dangerously rapid heart rate and increased blood pressure, headache, dizziness, auditory and visual dysfunction, confusion or dementia, convulsions, unconsciousness, acute renal failure, and both respiratory and cardiac arrest.

Contamination might occur in several different ways. The most common source of carbon monoxide is the exhaust from an internal combustion engine (such as an automobile engine), and contamination will occur if that exhaust is allowed to enter the intake of a compressor system.

Contamination can occur within the compressor system itself due to poor maintenance, when filters begin to fail and internal lubricants begin to breakdown. Contamination can also occur with the improper handling of 100% oxygen under high pressure, as may be the case in blending nitrox and trimix, due to internal flashing (momentary ignition) within the compressor lines or cylinder.

Though carbon monoxide itself is odorless and tasteless, it is often accompanied by other contaminates (such as those in an automobile's exhaust), and divers should avoid breathing any gas that has a hint of a smell or taste.

If a diver convulses or becomes unconscious underwater, the diver's buddy should immediately render assistance by taking physical control of the affected diver and then start a controlled ascent to the surface. Upon surfacing administer appropriate first aid measures. Subsequent treatment may include hyperbaric chamber therapy; however, its benefit in helping to flush carbon monoxide from the body remains the subject of debate among medical authorities. Following an acute episode of carbon monoxide toxicity, there is some possibility of subsequent neurological complications arising days, or even weeks, later.

## Methods of Instruction

Educational theory as it applies to explaining and defining "learning" is an ever-changing and rather complex field of study. It is not the intent of this chapter to delve into such theories and analyze what they entail. Rather, the goal is to discuss the basic elements of teaching and learning processes as they apply to the SDI Open Water Scuba Diver Instructor and form the foundation of scuba education. Building on this foundation, we will incorporate how to properly prepare for and deliver a presentation. And finally, we will discuss how to use assistants properly with the SDI Open Water Scuba Diver program and other continuing education courses.

### Learning

SDI Open Water Scuba Diver Instructors are qualified to teach specific programs as defined in the SDI Instructor standards. With that in mind, it's important that the open water scuba diver instructor has a basic understanding of how people learn and how to effectively teach the appropriate concepts and skills. There are three key factors regarding learning that need to be discussed:

**First** - Every person learns differently. Some people read a book once and grasp the subject matter, while others prefer to have the subject read or narrated to them. Still others learn best by applying what they read or hear. Those students need to have "hands on" before they can learn.

**Second** - Learning retention can be identified. When someone learns something new, there is a permanent and observable change in their behavior.

**Third** - Learning retention is quantifiable. There are several ways to measure a student's retention. These include talking to the student about the subject matter, giving the student time to practice what was learned or observed, and by testing the student to evaluate their comprehension.

While this may seem oversimplified, these three factors are what scuba education is basically all about. Now, let's go a little deeper and examine the relevant principles that make up the learning process.

### Factors that Affect Learning

Many things can have an impact on an individual-s ability to learn. Some of these things may be quite obvious, while others may not be as apparent. What-s important is that the educator, the SDI OWSDI - understands the primary principles of learning as they apply to diver education. The learning principles that are relevant to this course are: Readiness, Intensity, Primacy, Exercise and Effect.

#### Readiness

"Learning Readiness" is simply a term used to describe a student's condition in relation to learning, i.e. their preparedness. This includes both immediate and overall condition.

> In regard to their immediate condition, students' readiness can be determined by evaluating whether they are mentally, physically and emotionally prepared to learn.

When evaluating the students' overall condition, one must consider factors such as age, level of education, employment status and to some extent socioeconomic status. These factors can play a major role in the students' combined readiness for a scuba course. For instance, when teaching children and adults simultaneously, the instructor has to consider many different things, first and foremost, the age differences of the participants and how that may affect their preparedness. For instance, the time of day the course is conducted may be a contributing factor. In the morning, an adult may be ready to learn, whereas a child may still want to be in bed sleeping. Conversely, an adult may not be as ready to learn after a long day at work, while a child who is still attending school may already be mentally prepared to learn. While comparing age groups, another consideration is time availability. An adult may be unable to complete a homework assignment due to a hectic work schedule, whereas a child, accustomed to doing homework, may enjoy having a break from the typical homework assignments he gets in school. While this has addressed mental preparedness in relation to students' ages (and additional factors that come with age), there are also physical signs that should be evaluated.

Physical preparedness or the lack thereof (as with hunger and illness) affects both the young and the old. While there is nothing the OWSDI can do about the student being ill, other than to send them home to get some rest - something can be done about hunger. If the course schedule runs through normal meal times, one of two things must take place: meals and refreshments need to be provided or an appropriate break that allows for mealtime should be built into the schedule. If a break is added, ensure that a list of local places to get refreshments or food is provided for those who are unfamiliar with the local area. Another consideration is body temperature; the student may become cold while either in pool/confined water or open water, and this can also be a concern in the classroom. In addition to the obvious concerns about hypothermia, students that are cold will focus only on being cold and not the task at hand.

Evaluating students' readiness is generally a passive exercise on the part of the OWSDI as there is little the OWSDI can do to affect students' overall readiness for a scuba course. However, with proper planning and good judgment, instructors can have an immediate and direct affect on how well the students adapt and progress through the course.

> While the OWSDI may have little control over students' readiness to learn, they have more direct control of the "intensity" of the course.

#### Intensity

Simply put, the principle of "Intensity" is based on the idea that students are more likely to learn skills and gain knowledge from a real situation or a simulated reality situation versus learning from a description or reading about the skills and how knowledge is applied. As such, the progression of becoming an SDI Open Water Scuba Diver is a well-established example of increasing intensity.

First, the student reads the student manual and watches the associated video or takes the online academics. Here the intensity is low since practical application is, for the most part, non-existent. However, in this stage the instructional staff can increase intensity by putting extra effort into making their time out of the water with the student as practical as possible. Using visual aids and utilizing workshops in which the student actively participates in the learning are good examples of ways to increase intensity. A typical example of this is demonstrating the correct way to assemble the scuba equipment in the classroom or on the showroom floor, and then having the student practice it under the guidance of the instructional staff.

Second, the student applies his newly gained knowledge in a controlled in-water situation at the pool or confined water environment. It is here that the student puts into immediate practice the skills he has learned. In this case the student is much more likely to retain the information as they will have applied it in a real situation. Therefore, intensity is much higher in this instance.

Third, the student is placed in an actual open water scuba diving situation to demonstrate that they have retained the material and can successfully apply it to an actual situation.

When considering intensity, ask the following questions: Why is one course more memorable than another? Was the instructor more animated? Were they more dynamic? Did they encourage student participation? All of these may be factors and should be considered when planning and teaching a course. Think about courses you completed that were particularly helpful and fun. What made them so? Chances are good that if you emulate the classes you most enjoyed, your students will enjoy yours as well.

> By incorporating intensity into the course, students are likely to have a better experience and are therefore more likely to retain the information.

In addition to incorporating intensity, it's vital that students are taught and perform scuba skills correctly the first time they are introduced to them. This is what is referred to as "Primacy."

#### Primacy

Primacy is basically a fancy word for "do it right the first time." Prior to reaching the dive professional levels of training, courses consisted of repetitive knowledge and skills, all of which were first presented and demonstrated by the instructor to help ensure accuracy the first time they were attempted by the student, with the notable exception of divemaster and assistant instructor courses.

> Remember, students will generally attempt to perform a skill for the first time exactly as it was shown to them.

At the very least, that is the image that will burn into their memory. This is why a lot of time is spent during a professional level course ensuring skills are performed to demonstration quality. It's much easier to teach a skill correctly and in the correct order the first time than it is to try to help a student unlearn a skill or skills that they have made habit.

One of the best ways for an instructor to follow a functional and relevant pattern of instruction time after time is to use lesson plans and skills checklists. As such, SDI has made available academic presentation forms for use in the classroom and skills cue cards for use in the pool and open water. Not only do these aides help the instructor follow a logical progression, but they help ensure that knowledge and skills are taught in a logical sequence the first time and every time.

The next principle we will discuss is "exercise," which in its purist form basically states that skills and applied knowledge become second nature if they are repeated often. As you read the next section, think about the principle of primacy and why it is integral to the principle of exercise.

#### Exercise

Much of the knowledge and many of the skills involved in scuba diving are unique to the sport. There are very few skills that apply elsewhere, with the exception of certain water sports. As a result, the principle of exercise is a very important part of an SDI Open Water Scuba Diver Instructor's responsibility, since the OWSDI is often responsible for correcting students' errors in practice. Remember, the principle of exercise is basically reinforcing that "perfect practice, makes perfect."

In regard to the academic portion of the course, the student reads the manual or completes the online training, answers the knowledge review questions and finally, reviews this knowledge with the assistant instructor or instructor to ensure comprehension. Throughout the academic sessions, the instructional staff asks redundant questions to reinforce retention.

For the skills or in-water portion of the course, skills are properly demonstrated (remember the principle of primacy) and then are correctly practiced by the student over and over again. It is the OWSDI's role to correct the student should he make a mistake. All of this repetitiveness starts and reinforces the process of making the student's reaction second nature. The end goal is that the new diver will be relaxed and can enjoy dives because they are comfortable in what they are doing, and trust in their ability. This leads us to the final principle, the principle of "effect."

#### Effect

Simply, the principle of effect says that if a student is having a good and enjoyable experience (while learning), then their learning is increased; however, if they are having a bad or negative experience, their learning is decreased.

> This is why positive reinforcement is integral to the success of the students and the principle of effect should be observed and evaluated for each student throughout the course.

If the student is not having an enjoyable time, then it is likely that they are not optimizing their learning. This is also another reason negative reinforcement is discouraged. After all, the student is paying to learn how to scuba dive and should have an enjoyable experience.

In the end, what will be observed is the value of the information provided when it is practiced and applied. Sometimes this doesn't happen during the course but later, after the diver has had an opportunity to apply what they've learned on a pleasure dive. The greatest thing an instructor can hear is "I used what I learned during the course on one of my dives and it worked great."

#### Generational Differences

The final aspect that can affect learning is the age differences between students. This was discussed briefly in the readiness section; in this section we will go into more detail. There are four different sets of students when it comes to age: Silent Generation, Baby Boomers, Gen Xers and Generation Y, each requiring a slightly different method of teaching.

##### The Silent Generation

The Silent Generation describes a group of people born between the early 1920's and early 1940's. While this is a small portion of the students that will appear in the classroom, they do still appear and as such, knowing how they learn and respond is very important. The Silent Generation is known to have a strong work ethic, which carries over into their study habits - they are very disciplined and prefer to schedule courses for the morning hours. Other qualities of the Silent Generation are:

- Respects authority
- Prefers to communicate in a direct and formal manner
- Self motivated and does not require a lot of direction
- Like simple black and white text as opposed to flashy presentations

##### Baby Boomers

Baby Boomers are perhaps one of the larger groups of divers. This describes people born between 1945 and 1964. Like the Silent Generation they are hard workers but maybe even more extreme, and can be workaholics. Baby Boomers are very efficient as a generation and can be perfectionists, and therefore may demand the same from their instructor. Some traits that are unique to them include:

- Prefer tactile learning (hands on)
- Are sensitive to temperature of learning environment
- Question authority
- View criticism in a negative way
- Like simple black and white text as opposed to flashy presentations

##### Gen Xers

Gen Xers were born roughly between 1965 and 1980. They also comprise a large percentage of people taking dive courses. Like the previous two generations, Gen Xers are hard workers; however, they like to get the job done fast so they can move onto something new. As a result, a Gen Xer may say they understand something just for the sake of moving on. The learning environment for Gen Xers needs to be fun and have a higher degree of freedom. Other traits to be aware of include:

- Respond best to structured learning objectives with clear goals
- May benefit from having a schedule including when assignments will be due
- Like immediate feedback on all tasks they are asked to perform
- Prefer to have courses scheduled in the evening

##### Generation "Y" aka the "Millennials"

The final generation is generation "Y" also known as the "Millennials." They were born between the early 1980's and early 2000. This generation moves in a fast pace world where information is presented in short burst and should be full of action. Colorful PowerPoint® presentations along with videos work well. This is also the generation that will fully embrace online learning technology. They also like to get where they are going fast and if encouraged, will take more courses and move up through the diving ranks. Some characteristics that generation "Y" has include:

- Enjoy humor while learning
- Do their own research
- Tolerant of differences in opinion
- Have limited brand loyalty and will follow a trend or the latest new thing
- Are team players
- Perform better when rewarded for job well done

All of the above is a generalization and potentially geographically specific. Without a doubt it may not apply to all students even if they fit into the age categories, but it will help the OWSDI candidate understand and prepare for divers that will be taking courses. There are many factors that affect learning and the message here is to keep the mind open to new ideas and always try a different approach if the current one is not working. Once the instructor better understands the students' background based and their applicable generation, the instructor can tailor his delivery methods as appropriate.

## Methods of Instruction 2

### Phases of Teaching

Now that we've covered the basics of how people learn, we can examine the phases of teaching and how each is applied in a learning environment. This is effectively "how to teach."

The phases of teaching as they relate to this course are: Assessment, Presentation, Application and Evaluation. Each phase is as important as the next, and so is the order in which they are implemented. Each phase and how it relates to the next will be discussed in this section.

#### Assessment

During the assessment phase the instructional staff evaluates each student's general condition as well as the overall dynamic of the group. While conducting the assessment, it's extremely important that the instructors evaluate the big picture so that each element of the students' readiness is considered as part of the whole. This is also the phase in which the students' readiness is evaluated (as discussed in the previous section).

When conducting the assessment the following points should be considered:

First, the instructional staff should assess the students that will be in the course. This is best done during and after the first academic session. Examples of the conditions that should be evaluated include:

**Student Age(s) and Maturity Level** - Is the class comprised of children, adults or a mixture of both, and what is the age range of the adults? The answers to these questions will help determine the most appropriate way to deliver the academics. For example, adults typically ask questions and probe knowledge with little to no incentive to do so from the instructional staff. This will help gauge what the students already know and what needs to be expanded upon. Alternatively, when teaching children, the instructional staff may need to ask them direct or probing questions, as children are often apprehensive or shy. However, maturity levels in children can be wide ranging. Often, a mature youth will assert himself more and learn and perform better than an adult lacking maturity. So beware of preconceptions when assessing students, they may often surprise you.

**Past Water Experience** - What are the students' comfort levels in the water? Have they ever participated in swim classes? Have they dived before? Do they enjoy other water sports? This information will provide valuable insight to the instructional staff as to potential student apprehension that should be addressed.

**Partner Dependence** - Are there students who are taking the course with a spouse, partner or other family member? If so, do they seem dependent on the other person? Does it help or hinder them? A good example of this is a situation where a father and son take the course together for the first time. In this case, the son may feel dependent on the father's assistance since that's what he has come to learn through his past experiences with his father. If the father is removed from the picture, the child may excel. Of course, often this isn't the best solution. However, a brief and private discussion with the father regarding the situation may open new doors for the child to progress in a more positive manner. Alternatively, an individual may be overly critical of their partner's performance. Again, it's important that the instructors recognize the situation through their assessment and take appropriate action so that each individual can progress in a positive and fun environment.

Remember, in addition to the classroom, this same assessment procedure should be applied before, during and after the first in-water session

Proper and timely assessment of the students will help ensure that the instructional staff do not bore the students with information they already know or overwhelm them by advancing too quickly. It also helps identify and solve issues that could create or already are learning barriers. At the very least, a good assessment will give the instructors a much clearer picture of who their students are, which ultimately helps in the next phase: the presentation phase.

#### Presentation

Following the assessment phase, the instructional staff should have a much better idea of whom they will be teaching. As a result, they should be better equipped to formulate and deliver a presentation tailored to the group. The presentation should start with an explanation to the students of what they will be learning. It should be clear and concise and each subject should be separated out into small, manageable portions. Doing so will also help identify logical stopping points in the curriculum, which provides opportunities for the students to ask questions (in private or away from the rest of the class), stretch and get refreshments. For example, when teaching the SDI Underwater Navigation course, the instructor covers the use of mechanical and electronic compasses, what affects them, and how to properly care for and maintain them. Before moving on to the natural navigation presentation, the instructor allows the group to take a five-minute break to refresh themselves.

> When developing presentations, instructors need to be sure that each subject has a clear objective and well-defined timeline. Breaks should be strategically placed within the timeline, and most importantly, the instructor needs to do their best to stick to it.

In addition, the timeline should be communicated to the students prior to starting, so they know what to expect and won't be wondering when they are going to get a break instead of focusing on the subject matter.

Creating and delivering a good presentation is vital to the overall validity and progression of the course. Naturally, there are many factors such as behavioral objectives and visual aids that must be considered when developing presentations. These considerations are covered later in this chapter.

In terms of scuba education, a presentation generally includes a segment or segments of time when the students will apply their newly gained knowledge. In fact, these practice periods are particularly recommended as the class increases in "intensity," since this tends to increase retention (as was explained in the previous section).

#### Application

Very simply, the application phase of learning occurs when students "apply" what they have learned. Such application can be done in almost any location, but as previously discussed in the primacy section, it;s vital that they apply the knowledge in the appropriate sequence and perform skills correctly the first time. Should they fail to perform the skill or apply the knowledge correctly the first time, the SDI OWSDI must be there to correct them in a positive way.

Continuing with the example of the SDI Navigation course: As part of his presentation, the instructor issues each student a compass mounted to a slate. He takes the class outside to the parking lot and gives instruction on how to properly set the bezel while holding the compass level, in order to take a single heading course. He then provides instruction on how to complete a reciprocal course. At the conclusion of his demonstration, he instructs the students to apply the knowledge and complete the same exercise on their own.

Conducting land drills or "dry drills" prior to performing anything in-water will help the divers better understand what is required of them underwater. This same application of theory can be used in the academic setting as well. For example, when teaching the SDI Marine Eco System Awareness course an instructor could ask the divers to identify benthic (bottom dwelling) and pelagic (mid-water) marine life from a book. By doing so, the students have to practically apply what they have learned about the definitions of benthic and pelagic marine life.

As with any learning situation, there should be an evaluation phase to test how much of the information taught was retained.

#### Evaluation

Once the subject has been presented and the students have had an opportunity to apply and reapply what they have learned, their knowledge retention will need to be evaluated. Of the many ways to test the retention and understanding of subjects that were presented, the most common methods are by examination or skill performance or a combination of both.

Examinations are not always written, although this is ideal for record keeping; they can also be verbal. Throughout the course students should be asked questions. If the answer is correct, the student experiences positive reinforcement; however, if the answer is incorrect, the explanation the instructor provides should serve as an additional opportunity for all students to grasp the concept. This is a form of examination and is best used at the end of each lecture session. To ensure that all students retain and understand what was discussed, questions should be asked of each student in an even distribution.

The written exam is more straightforward. Each student answers the questions to the best of their ability, and hands it in to be corrected. Generally speaking, most SDI written exams have a minimum passing score. However, all of the questions that the student answered incorrectly are to be reviewed together by the student and instructor to ensure that the student has 100% understanding of what they missed.

Skill performance exams are also pretty straightforward. In this case, the student is asked to perform a skill or a series of skills with a predetermined degree of accuracy. How accurately the student performs the skill(s) determines if they will successfully pass or not.

Returning to the SDI Navigation course scenario for an example of a typical skill performance exam: To test the students' skill performance for completing a reciprocal course, the instructor asks the students to swim out 50 kick cycles and return to within 3m /10 feet of where they started. When performing the skill, one diver of the buddy team is to hold the compass and set the direction, while the other is to monitor depth and watch out for obstacles in their path. If the buddy team returns within 3m/10 feet of the location they left from, they have passed the exam.

> The final and perhaps most important "test" is the instructor's assessment of the students' comfort level in the water. The instructor should observe each student through all phases of the dive and evaluate whether their comfort has increased or they are still nervous. Students who continue to be nervous may need additional time with the instructor, possibly on a one-on-one basis.

Ultimately, each phase of teaching is necessary for the next to be successful.

### Learning Objectives

Learning objectives (objectives) are a core part of every presentation, and usually are used in the introduction of new subjects. In some cases the objectives may be described as performance-based outcomes, or behavioral objectives. In other words, they are what the student will understand, be able to describe or be able to do at the conclusion of the presentation, and in the case of behavioral objectives, what behavior will be elicited from the student or subject. By establishing the objectives, an instructor knows what he must teach and the students know what is expected of them. Objectives should be brief, concise and have a measurable outcome, and should be provided in both theory and skill presentations.

When creating objectives, the instructor should evaluate his audience and what they should be able to describe or do at the conclusion of the presentation. In addition, the objective should define any specific conditions under which the objective must be met and how well it must be done. A simple way to remember how to write an objective is the “ABCD” format.

**Audience** – Who?

**Behavior** – What should the student be able to do?

**Condition** – Under what conditions is the student being asked to perform this?

**Degree** – How well must it be done?

CPRFor example, when performing CPR during the CPROX1stAED course, students are asked to maintain a constant rate of compressions per minute and administer two breaths every thirty seconds for a specified period of time. Using the above “ABCD” format, a good example of the objective would be:

“By the end of this exercise, using a mannequin, the student will be able to maintain 100 compressions per minute for one minute, pausing every 30 seconds to administer two breaths. The student will continue this cycle for five minutes.”

In this example we established the Audience, the student; the Behavior, maintain 100 compressions per minute for one minute, pausing every 30 seconds to administer two breaths; the Condition, using a mannequin; and the Degree, continue this cycle for five minutes.

Writing objectives using this format helps ensure that there is little to no ambiguity as to what is expected of the student or instructor. It creates specific, measurable goals that can be quickly and easily evaluated by both the student and the instructor.

### Instructional Theory - Phases of Learning

There are four basic phases of learning as they relate to instructional theory. They are: Stimulus, Response, Reinforcement and Motivation. We will discuss each of these phases and provide examples how to use and recognize them.

#### Stimulus

Stimulus is also known as an attention-getting step. At the beginning of a presentation, a statement combined with the appropriate body language should be made to get the students' attention and encourage them to listen to what is being said or demonstrated. An effective attention-getting step will cause a response.

Because presentations will be done above and below the water, ways to get the students' attention in both environments should be considered. On the surface, such an action could be a verbal statement such as: "Have you ever been looking through a magazine or watching a movie and wondered what the marine life was that you were seeing?" This would be a good attention-getting step when teaching the SDI Marine Eco System course.

The attention-getting step may have a few elements that could be included. For instance, it is best if the subject can be related to something the students already know; in the example above it was "magazine or movie." It should also relate to the subject "marine life." While not all attention-getting steps have to relate to the subject, they should at a minimum relate to something the students already know. They should also be easy to apply to the subject that will be presented.

Underwater, the attention-getting step is relatively simple. A sound should be made either by clapping hands together or by using a mechanical noise-making device followed by hand signals advising the students to watch the demonstration.

#### Response

Depending on the type of opening stimulus or attention-getting step, there should be a visual or verbal response from the students indicating that their focus has been established. In a classroom or academic setting students may respond in kind, or visually turn their attention to the presenter. In an underwater setting the students generally respond by physically and visually recognizing the attention-getting step. In most cases, the instructor asks if the students are "OK" to proceed by directing the "OK" hand signal in their direction and waiting to receive the signal in return.

#### Reinforcement

Now that the students have listened to the presentation or performed the skill, it is time to reinforce their response. There will be a difference in how the response is reinforced depending on whether the students and instructor are in or above the water.

Above the water, questions should be asked about the subject that was presented. In the best case scenario the student understands what was presented and answers the question correctly. This would deserve positive reinforcement such as: "that is correct, very good." Should the student answer the question incorrectly, they must be provided with an explanation of the correct answer.

Underwater, if the student performs the skill but not within the acceptable range of success, the SDI OWSDI should demonstrate the skill again, emphasizing the portion of the skill the student did not successfully complete. Once the student performs the skill correctly the positive reinforcement can be as simple as an ok sign or an over-emphasized clap or a handshake. This confirms for the student that they were successful.

> Sincere reinforcement will increase the likelihood of additional positive responses from the students. As such, it is critical that the OWSDI respond to a positive student outcome with genuine sincerity. This is one of the most important aspects of reinforcement.

#### Motivation

Motivation is an essential part of learning. In most cases, students come to learn. Why are they there? Is it because they want to be or does someone else want them there? Are they enthusiastic and raring to go or not at all sure they are ready to venture into the underwater world? These are important points to consider whenever you begin a new class. A dive educator must ensure the students not only learn the concepts but are eager to perfect the knowledge and skills that will enable them to enjoy diving from their very first experience in the water. With proper and straightforward motivation, students will gain the skills and confidence to master the task at hand, and thereby be ready to progress and have fun. Motivation can be delivered several ways: through continual positive reinforcement of proper behavior; by guiding students down a successful and rewarding path; and by providing them with a strong understanding of why they need to know the skill, or why the knowledge is important. An additional simple form of motivation is "cause and effect." For example, educating students as to why they should not hold their breath underwater is a form of motivation. In this case, the motivation is the non-effect: to be able to dive another day.

Returning to our SDI Navigation class, an example of motivation would be to provide a value statement to the students: "By knowing how to navigate underwater the student will easily be able to return to their entry point, therefore making the dive more enjoyable."

As we've said, motivation comes in many forms. In fact, examples can be found almost anywhere. It is the OWSDI's job to find or create appropriate examples, and use them to the students' benefit.

## Methods of Instruction, Part 3

### General Teaching Methods

Simply put, teaching is the conveyance of information from one person to another. One responsibility of the teacher is to assess what the student knows already and build upon the existing knowledge. There are a few ways a student can obtain additional knowledge - through oral presentations, online training, Internet forums, guided discussion or doing pleasure dives. In this section, oral presentations, guided discussion and online training will be discussed.

#### Oral Presentations

Perhaps one of the longest standing and best-tested forms of teaching is oral presentation. This form of teaching appeals to a wide range of students and teachers alike. In face-to-face lectures, the students can ask questions as subjects are presented and interact with the instructor one-on-one. Additionally, the instructor has the opportunity to verbally test the students, as well as see and respond to their reactions. The other large benefit is the building of rapport between both parties (this will be discussed later in Factors That Influence Communication).

Presenting information to a group of students is the fundamental basis of scuba instruction. As such, it is important for the dive professional to overcome any fear of public speaking they may have. While there are tricks to controlling this fear, a little nervousness is not a bad thing. Being nervous indicates that the presenter cares about the impression they make, and that the information they are providing is correct and in a logical order.

Another important part of a presentation is the use of visual aids. In some cases, visual aids are nothing more than handouts of the information that will be discussed. As an example, when giving a presentation using PowerPoint ®, students can be handed an outline so that they may follow along. Simply print out the slides using the handouts feature in the program. Providing the outline to the students will help them stay focused on what's being taught, as well as give them a handy place to take notes.

As was discussed in earlier sections, utilizing the equipment the students are learning about during a presentation is highly recommended, and a great way to implement the use of training aids. For example, when teaching the SDI Underwater Navigation course and discussing compasses, compasses can be handed out for the students to hold and look at. Many people learn better by touching and doing.

Oral presentation is an age-old, tried and tested method of information delivery. However, over time many modifications have been made to the traditional format of the teacher addressing a group. One such modification is bringing the group together for discussion under the guidance of the teacher/instructor.

#### Guided Discussion

Guided discussion can be a great way for the instructor to answer any questions the students have, while at the same time assessing how much information the students have retained. In this format, students get a chance to interact with each other and discuss the topics that were covered. In this scenario, it's important that the instructor only listen and interact or interject when needed. However, it is the instructor's responsibility to keep the discussion on track.

> The two key factors the instructor should constantly monitor and maintain are topics and time.

The topics under discussion should relate to the course and not go beyond its scope. It's easy for anyone to get off on a tangent, and it's human nature to follow along. Stopping these distractions when they start is the instructor's responsibility and will keep the discussion on track. In reference to time, open or guided discussions tend to go on too long without proper guidance; therefore, the duration of the discussion should be just long enough for all of the relevant questions to be answered and for the objective to be met. Managing guided discussions takes practice, but if done properly, they can be very effective and more fun for the student.

#### Online Training

One of the latest advents to the scuba diving industry is online training, also known as blended learning. While this is not a new concept in many other industries, it may take some time to get used to.

Online training does not replace the need for face-to-face interaction; it does however, give the dive professional a chance to apply what they would normally do in the classroom in a new way. When using online training, the dive professional can watch the progress of the students, send them emails or call them to discuss the course and answer questions.

When students complete the academics online, they are essentially cutting out the fat. Doing so facilitates a more efficient face-to-face interaction between the student and instructional staff because the majority of the time can now be spent on hands-on training and knowledge and skill application. This is very valuable time because the student builds trust with the professional earlier and the professional has a chance to assess the student sooner.

Currently SDI offers many of its courses online and will continue to develop and adapt more of them as time progresses.

### Factors that Influence Communication

This section looks at factors that influence effective communication as they apply to the instructor. These factors and principles should be considered and applied where necessary when giving presentations and interacting with students.

#### Vocal Expression

> Vocal expression is one of the most important tools a presenter has in his arsenal.

The key elements of vocal expression are pitch, volume and rate of speech. Pitch, commonly referred to as "voice inflection," is the tone or modulation of the voice as it goes from high to low, or vice versa. The use of inflection allows us to show emotion through speech. It helps convey the excitement or importance of a topic. It also helps keep the students engaged in the presentation. The presenter who speaks in a monotone fashion quickly looses the interest of their audience.

When speaking to a group, presenters must be constantly aware of the volume of their voice. If they are too loud, students may focus on the volume rather than the information. If they are too quiet, the students won't be able to hear the information and in many cases, students won't inform the presenter they can't hear unless asked. Therefore, it's in the presenter's best interest to ask the group if his volume is sufficient. Volume can also be used in combination with pitch to inject excitement and gain the attention of the group. However, excessive volume can also be mistakenly interpreted as a negative emotion such as anger. To help avoid this, it's recommended that presenters practice their delivery and solicit input from the group.

The speed or rate at which a presenter speaks also has an impact on the way the information is interpreted. In fact, the rate of speech should be appropriately adjusted if there are any special circumstances. For instance, are there children in the class? If so, they may benefit from a decreased rate of speech, as would a translator or someone with a learning disability. This information may not be known prior to class, so it is up to the dive professional to monitor the group and make adjustments if anyone is struggling to keep up. Others, such as translators or those with learning disabilities, may need additional one-on-one time with the presenter to help ensure that they understand the subject matter.

Proper vocal expression is important if the students are to correctly interpret and understand the information being presented; however, if the students can't get past the appearance of the presenter, their vocal expression will make little difference. 

#### Image

An instructor who stands before a group of students and looks well put together will gain the respect and trust of the students faster and more easily than one who looks like they just fell out of bed. In most cases, first impressions are based on overall appearance. They are long lasting and difficult to change. That is why it is vital that the instructor look the part. This includes wearing appropriate clothing that is characteristic of the dive facility they represent and avoiding any clothing that is damaged, ripped or torn. Also, as a general rule, it's not appropriate for a presenter to wear a hat indoors unless it is part of the approved uniform.

When addressing the group, the presenter should appear relaxed even if they are feeling nervous. They should stand in an upright position and avoid pacing at the front of the room. In a casual classroom setting it is ok for the instructor to sit amongst the students, but he should avoid slouching in the chair or putting his feet up. Either way, sitting or standing - the presenter should keep his head high, project his voice and keep constant eye contact with the class.

#### Nervousness

As stated earlier, a little bit of nervousness is expected and should go away a few minutes after beginning the presentation. However, there are a few things a presenter can do to help minimize the impact of nervousness.

**Practice, Practice and Practice** - It's highly recommended that the instructor practice their presentation a few times. This can be done with no one around, in front of a video camera or in front of select family and friends who are willing to provide honest input. If using a video camera, the presenter should review the presentation, take notes on areas he can improve on, and implement the changes in the next practice presentation

**Use Training Aids** - While the use of visual aids is recommended, the presenter should be sure to use visual aids that he is familiar with. When using a PowerPoint® or custom presentation, it's important that the presenter review it completely several times to help ensure there are no surprises. In addition, the presenter should check for typos and make a list of questions and topics that may come up.

**Some Final Tricks of the Trade** - The presenter may benefit from taking a few quiet minutes before starting the presentation. During this time he should take a few deep, slow breaths and think about the subject and how he will deliver the presentation to the group.

With all of this said, the most important thing for the presenter to do is focus on getting the information to the students clearly, not quickly.

#### Teaching Tools

There is a wide range of teaching tools available from SDI for the SDI Open Water Scuba Diver Instructor to use in his presentations. These include diver manuals, instructor guides, PowerPoint® presentations, cue cards and posters. Of course, any piece of scuba equipment or scuba related item might be used as a teaching tool as well.

When properly used, teaching tools can act as a guide for the instructor to follow. Take a scuba mask for example: The instructor could begin with what type of mask is it, high or low volume; what the mask skirt is made out of, and why that's important; and what options are important to consider when choosing a mask.

Used as a teaching tool, PowerPoint® is both interactive and helps the presenter manage his time. PowerPoint® helps the presenter keep the presentation on track and cover all the points that need to be discussed. Additionally, after using the presentation a few times, the presenter will have a good idea how long the presentation takes from start to finish. Also, the slides should augment the verbal presentation but not be a written version of it. Presenters must use their own words, experiences and perspective to bring what's in the PowerPoint® to life.

When using digital systems, it's recommended that the presenter set up the equipment prior to class and go through one or two "dry runs." By doing so, unpleasant surprises will be avoided and the overall presentation will be more professional.

#### Visual Aids

Visual aids enhance communication and can be a valuable part of any lesson. As discussed earlier, each person learns differently and the visual aid helps those that learn better by seeing and perhaps touching. For example, when teaching the SDI Underwater Video course, imagine trying to explain how to clean and inspect an O-ring without having one? What if you needed to show how a latch locks a video housing shut in order to keep it watertight? This would make perfect sense to the student if a video housing were available for the student to see and feel.

> Visual training aids can also serve as a distraction. When teaching a refresher course or buoyancy course it's a good idea for the instructor to bring along some water toys. The students will start playing with the toys, adults and children alike; this takes their mind off buoyancy and suddenly their buoyancy improves.

Always have the training aids available before the course begins. Valuable time can be wasted looking for training aids at the last minute.

Proper preparation before any segment will help the instructor minimize potential problems and increase their confidence level knowing they are prepared.

#### Reading Body Language

Reading body language is an art that takes time and practice to master. However, there are some basic signs that we can all recognize. When teaching classes later in the evening or after mealtime, it is fairly easy to recognize signs of fatigue such as eyes closing or heads nodding. This generally indicates that it is time for a break so the students can get up and move around. A less obvious sign would be students' eyes drifting around the classroom. This may be a sign of boredom and is a good indication that it is time to get that student engaged in the presentation. This can be done by asking them a question or redirecting their attention to a training aid.

Reading students' body language in the water is important since it applies to easing their nervousness. For example, relaxed students will swim along and observe their surroundings while nervous students may not let go of the low-pressure inflator or take their eyes off of their buddy. The instructor must immediately address a nervous student when he observes the signs. In this case, the instructor should gain the attention of the student by giving them the "OK" signal. If the student fails to respond, he should be brought to the surface where the instructor can make sure he is OK.

Additional signs of nervousness that may be observed in a student include constant fidgeting; an individual who is abnormally quiet or abnormally talkative; or unwarranted anxiety. The instructor should observe the students before, during, and after a dive and help students resolve any issues if they appear nervous or anxious.

#### Trust

A strong rapport is built on trust, the more trust there is in a relationship, the better the rapport will be. Students have a basic level of trust in their dive leader(s) or they would not have enrolled in the course. However, it is up to the dive professional to nurture and grow that trust. This can be done several ways and at different times. For instance, the dive professional can contact the student before the course begins to introduce himself, answer any questions the student may have and describe the course progression. During the course, the dive professional should be friendly, helpful and approachable. The professional must follow through with requests made of him, and above all, treat every student with respect. Once a good rapport is established, the student will likely come back to take additional courses as well as recommend the dive professional and dive facility to their friends and family.

Effective communication is not an innate human trait. It must be learned, practiced and carefully applied. All of these considerations require that the dive professional do a self-assessment and review their own performance prior to conducting a course. It is very important that the OWSDI looks and feels professional and prepares appropriately so that trust is established with the students.

## Methods of Instruction, Part 4

### Lesson Preperation

Up to this point, a great deal of information from learning theory to presentation considerations has been covered. In this section, it all comes together. Here we will discuss how to prepare for classroom and water sessions as well as how to deal with and avoid potential issues that may arise in each. We will start in the classroom.

#### Classroom

It is very important to understand how to effectively use and prepare for an academic or classroom session. The academic session, although traditionally conducted in a classroom, can be done at the dive site. In fact, for continuing education or refresher courses this may be an ideal setting. Whichever setting is used, proper preparation is required for each.

First, make sure all supplies needed for the course are easily accessible. The best thing to do is prepare a list of what is needed for every class. This list may include a computer, digital projector, and whiteboard with markers, instructor materials and visual aids. Make sure all electrical equipment is working properly and ensure there are extra materials for students, such as pencils, answer sheets or course materials. Ensure the classroom or area is clean, organized and presentable to the students. Pick up any trash or clutter that may be lying around. Remove any training aids that were used in previous courses. Make sure the lights are on and if there is a video of the underwater world available, make sure it is running and the volume is set at a moderate level.

When preparing to conduct the academic session at the dive site, ensure there is a shaded or covered area so the divers can get out of the sun or rain. The same general supplies will be needed; the only additional item that may be needed is some form of ground cover such as a tarp or blanket. The advantage of covering the academics onsite is that the students can apply what was discussed immediately.

> A lesson plan should be prepared that includes all the subjects that will be covered as well as the estimated time to cover each subject.

When planning a class session, be sure to include breaks every so often. If the session is in the morning, the lectures can go a little longer. However, if the session is in the evening, it is better to include frequent short breaks. While a lesson plan outlines all the topics that will be covered, an academic presentation form like the one below helps present each topic individually. The academic presentation form brings together all the elements that were previously discussed in the Teaching Theory and Methods section.

The academic session of a course is the time to cover subjects in detail and answer all of the questions the students may have. This is the students’ learning phase and it is the instructor’s responsibility to ensure they are learning and understanding all that is presented.

At the end of the academic session a brief explanation should be given of what to expect during the next academic session or what the students can expect at the pool/confined water or open water session. Be sure to provide details such as time, address, directions, where to park and what to do once they arrive.

#### Pool/Confined Water

The pool or confined water session of the course is the time when students are exposed to and practice skills in a controlled environment. Unlike the academic session, the practical session is more about doing and less about lecture.

One of the biggest considerations when preparing for the pool/confined water session is the site. What site will be used? Will there be lifeguards or other surface support? If using a pool, is the pool reserved and what section of the pool will be needed, shallow or deep? Just as was done for the academic session, a list of supplies should be created. The confined water list should include: weights, extra cylinders, extra scuba equipment, first aid supplies, oxygen kit and dive flag if using a confined water site that is exposed to open water. Be sure to bring along any training aids that may be needed such as objects to photograph when teaching a photo or video course and floating hoops for the buoyancy course.

When the students arrive at the pool/confined water site a briefing should be conducted that covers emergency procedures, a review of the knowledge and skills that will be covered during the session and finally, what hand signals will be used. The in-water presentation form can be completed and used by the instructor along with the cue cards.

Click [here](https://www.tdisdi.com/wp-content/uploads/files/IT_PDFs/Forms/In_Water_Presentation_Example.pdf) to download a PDF of a sample in-water presentation form.

By using the in-water presentation form and the cue cards the instructor should not overlook anything. The primary purpose of the pool/confined water session is to get the students in the water so they can apply what they have learned. This provides the instructor an opportunity to assess comfort level and retention of knowledge. The key here is to maximize the time in the water.

Skills must be briefed and demonstrated by the instructor so that the students have a clear understanding of what is expected. After every skill performance an evaluation should be conducted explaining how well the student did or correcting any poor skill performances. If a correction is needed, try to start and end the evaluation of students with a positive element, putting the negative or correction in the middle.

The pool/confined water session should be wrapped up with what can be expected in the next confined water session or what to expect during the open water session.

#### Open Water

Preparing for the open water session is similar to that of the pool/confined water. The biggest difference is that open water is used for final assessment. This is where the students get to demonstrate what they have learned and apply their skills in a real world environment.

If this is the first time that the students are getting into the water (since not all specialties require a confined or pool session) start them off slowly and in a shallow area if possible. By taking it slow, the instructor gets a chance to familiarize themselves with the students' abilities prior to getting into deep water.

Some areas that differ from confined or pool sites and should be noted are: tides, currents and boat traffic. When conducting the open water dives it is also good to have an assistant to help with control and any equipment issues that may arise.

### Training Materials

Now that the various portions of how to prepare for the course have been covered, it's time to discuss what materials the students have the option to use and how to use those materials effectively. In this section traditional materials (printed manuals) and online training (also known as blended learning) will be discussed.

#### Traditional Training Materials

In the early days of diving, the instructor had to directly convey information to the students since there were no training materials available. Generally, instructors taught diving the same way they had been taught, which in many cases was the "military way." The challenge for the instructors was to make the training enjoyable.

As years passed, various scuba training agencies were formed and with them, their own brand of training materials. Initially, the training material supported what the instructor was teaching. However, over time training material was standardized, and it became the instructor who supported the training material. In essence, the traditional method consists of the student reviewing the academic material prior to practical training with the instructor. As we have come to find, this method has been successful and has established a proven track record.

With the SDI System, the student first reads the manual and completes the knowledge quest answers. In addition they watch the CD or DVD. By using these materials the student is exposed to the information several times before they attend class. The repetition this system provides helps the student to retain the information.

During the class, the instructor reviews what the students have previously read and watched and increases the intensity by interjecting personal experiences. Additionally, he has the opportunity to begin teaching the students hand signals and to build a rapport with them.

As stated above, the student completes the knowledge quest booklet prior to the academic session. The instructor and students review the questions together to ensure the students have 100 percent comprehension of the information each question is testing. Following the review, the instructor collects the students' booklets and they become part of the students' training record. While this traditional method has been used successfully for many years, an alternate option is online learning.

#### Online Training

Though the name "online training" implies that the course is completed solely online, a better name for this style of learning is blended learning. Online training simply replaces a "hard copy" student manual. And, just like students taking a traditional class, online students must complete required sections prior to attending class.

To start, students log into the TDI/SDI website (https://www.tdisdi.com) or SDI Online Training website (www.sdi-onlinetraining.com), set up their personal profile and begin their academics. This method is very convenient for students who have Internet access.

During the sign up process the student must designate a facility with which they will be completing their training. After the student has set up their profile, the store they have designated will be notified. One of the major differences between traditional and online instruction is that the instructor can monitor the online student's online progress in real time. This gives the instructor or dive center the chance to send emails noting the student's good work, send dive center news letters or inform them of when the next classroom or pool session will be.

Once the students have completed the online academics, they are prompted to print out a detailed report to give to the instructor as verification that they have completed the online training.

After students complete the online academics, they schedule a time to go to the dive center and meet with an instructor. The SDI OWSDI now has an opportunity to meet the student face to face, get to know them, show them around the dive center and introduce them to the staff. The instructor has the opportunity to review the detailed report and answer any questions the student has, and ensure the student understands the subject. As stated previously, even though the SDI Online Training is set up to ensure 100 percent remediation, it is still important that the instructor ensures the student is comfortable with the subject matter.

Both the traditional and online learning have unique benefits; however, both accomplish the same goal: to educate the student about scuba. It is simply how each is used that makes the difference. Some students learn better by interacting with an instructor while others prefer to learn on their own and at their pace.

### Course Planning

This section will cover overall preparation and planning for a course, including dive management and various diving activities as they pertain to proper procedures for the water portion of a course. The information in this section is broad in scope and can be applied to any course the SDI Instructor may be teaching.

#### Preparation, Planning and Control in Dive Management and Diving Activities

Preparing and planning for a course begins long before the students ever set foot in the dive center. There are a lot of aspects the dive professional has to consider and many of them need to be planned well in advance of teaching a course. Examples of these include ensuring the proper dive equipment is available and that it has been serviced; checking that all membership fees and insurance premiums are paid; creating a course schedule for the next 12 months and being sure the pool/confined water and open water sites and boats will be available when needed. While it may seem premature to be thinking about these details, none of this is easy to deal with at the last minute. The SDI Dive Center will likely have established procedures and prepared many of these items; in fact, contracts may already be established for the pools or boats..

When planning the season's course schedule, a logical order should be followed. There should be a set of courses that flow through the season starting with the SDI Open Water Scuba Diver course and ending with SDI Assistant Instructor course. It is important that each year's schedule has professional level courses like assistant instructor because a critical part of dive management is proper support. At various points along the schedule there should be continuing education courses, rescue and non-training fun dives.

Fun dives that involve the customers and dive center staff are a great way to get to know customers and build a social network for the divers where they can find dive buddies and learn about opportunities to continue diving. During a diving event that is sponsored by the dive center there should be as many trained professionals on site as possible to serve as eyes, ears or dive buddies. 

> Proper support during diving activities is invaluable and a great risk management tool, even for the fun dives.

Assistant instructors and divemasters can be an extra set of eyes and quite commonly an extra set of ears. It is not uncommon for the students to confide in the assistant about their confusion or lack of understanding about subjects or skills. The assistant can then bring this information back to the instructor so the subject can be reviewed or the skill demonstrated again. Assistants are also invaluable when it comes to clerical or administrative tasks.

There is a lot of paperwork that goes into teaching a course and having an extra set of eyes to review that paperwork will ensure it is completed properly. If all the paperwork is completed and the students have been registered, this all adds up to great customer service and reduced liability.

Planning for the in-water portion of a course is no easy task but there are some things that can be done to smooth that process. As discussed earlier, knowing that the pool, open water and boats are available is a big relief but alternative sites still need to be considered. One factor that cannot be controlled is the weather; because of weather, alternate sites need to be planned for and available. If there are no alternate sites then extra days need to be built into the course schedule.

When thinking of alternate sites, one must look beyond open water sites. Outdoor pools and confined water sites can also be affected by the weather. While it may be harder to find an alternate pool or confined water site, it is not impossible. When looking for an alternate site, think of normal weather patterns and the typical way a storm comes in. This will indicate which way the waves will hit the shoreline during both good and bad weather. Always have a backup plan ahead of time so that if something happens, a change of plan takes place and the course runs smoothly.

Another important matter to address is emergency procedures. When teaching from a boat or at a pool, much of the required emergency equipment should already be available: phone or radio, oxygen kit, AED and trained personnel. However, when teaching at a remote site, each of these needs to be considered and addressed. Have an emergency management plan prepared for each dive location. This plan should include local emergency contact details, evacuation plan, and location of nearest medical facility. An onsite first aid kit and an oxygen kit should be available. If the dive site does not have cell phone coverage then the nearest phone needs to be located. Each site's emergency management plan needs to be in writing and communicated to all support staff.

The final item to consider is whether the site is appropriate for the course that will be taught. When teaching a Marine Eco System course a site with the widest range of marine life is the best choice. And when planning a boat specialty, remember to plan it for a date and/or season when a boat will be available

All that is left are the last minute details, which are inevitable but manageable if all the larger details have been worked out. Remember, a successful dive professional follows the six Ps: Proper Prior Planning Prevents Poor Performance.

If all foreseeable logistics have been thought out and planned for, courses will run smoothly and the students will have an enjoyable experience.

### Using Assistants While Teaching Courses

Using an assistant while teaching courses can be a huge time saver and reduce the normal stress levels of running a course. During the classroom portion of the training the SDI Assistant Instructor can conduct the knowledge quest review under the guidance of an active OWSDI. The assistant is also a second set of eyes to look over all the paperwork the OWSDI will need to review. The assistant can check that all forms are signed and initialed, verify that knowledge quest review sheets are turned in and ensure that medical history forms have been completed.

During the pool/confined water and open water portions of the training the SDI Assistant Instructor lends an extra set of eyes and ears that can watch and listen for worrisome situations that may occur and help eliminate those situations before they can cause problems.

Either in the pool/confined water or during the dives, the assistant can watch the rest of the group while the OWSDI works one-on-one with a student. The SDI Assistant Instructor can also lead dives 3 and 4 during the open water dives under the indirect supervision of the instructor, so long as the SDI OWSDI has evaluated and approved all of the skills and the students are proficient with them prior to the start of dives 3 and 4.

> The assistant instructor cannot evaluate any skill required for certification either above or below the surface of the water whether in the pool/confined water or during the open water dives.

How an assistant handles a problem either above or below water will largely depend on whether or not the OWSDI is present. Prior to the dive, the assistant and the OWSDI should discuss how to handle the various situations that could occur. Just as it is for the divers, it is very important for the assistant and the instructor to establish a clear set of hand signals. These hand signals should include an emergency signal that would indicate the divers need to surface or that the OWSDI will be surfacing with a diver and the assistant should bring all the other divers to the surface in a controlled manner.

Using assistants during courses is also a great way to train them. An assistant under the watchful eye of an OWSDI can learn a lot and be exposed to students in "real world" situations. An assistant that has worked with various instructors learns different styles of teaching and different problem solving methods. This will smooth their transition into higher levels of professional training.

The more an assistant and OWSDI work together the more they will know what to expect of each other should a situation arise. A good assistant is invaluable to an instructor.

> While it is difficult to establish a procedure to handle every situation that may occur, it is recommended that each facility try to establish a standard procedure for the most common scenarios. For this reason, it is highly recommended that facilities conduct an annual dive professional training session prior to the diving season.

### Summary: Chapters 11, 12, 13, and 14

This section covered everything from the basics of learning, and the phases of teaching to lesson preparation and course planning. Various methods of communication and the potential pitfalls to be aware of when delivering a presentation were discussed. Armed with this and the remainder of the information that was covered in the chapter, the SDI OWSDI should be able to successfully create and deliver a well-rounded presentation. In fact, after reading this chapter, one could say that the goal is to increase the "intensity" by applying what has been learned from this chapter in a practical, hands-on setting, thus increasing learning retention.

## Courses an Open Water Scuba Diver Instructor Can Teach

From the entry level open water scuba course through the dive professional training including the divemaster and assistant instructor program the SDI Open Water Scuba Diver Instructor is qualified to teach them all. In Chapter 15 all programs an SDI OWSDI is qualified to teach will be discussed. Let's start with the SDI Open Water Scuba Diver program.

### SDI Open Water Scuba Diver Program

The underwater adventure begins when an individual enrolls in the SDI Open Water Scuba Diver program. This course informs the new diver about the underwater environment, diving equipment and basic diving physics and physiology. During the pool /confined water portion of their training they will learn basic diving skills, how to use scuba diving equipment, as well as self- and buddy-aid techniques. When the student is comfortable and confident with their skills, they move on to a series of open water dives under the supervision of an instructor, in which the instructor conducts a final evaluation of their skills. Upon successful completion of the open water dives, candidates become certified SDI Open Water Scuba Divers and are "licensed" to dive with their buddy anywhere in the world without the supervision of a dive leader.

The open water scuba diver course academics can be completed online or via a standard student kit. Depending on how the course is structured the student may need to complete the entire online academic course or read the entire student manual and complete the knowledge quest before they attend their first skill development session.

Other support materials for the SDI Open Water Scuba Diver program include a knowledge quest, CD or DVD, PowerPoint® and instructor guide. The OWSDI guide is located in the appendix of the SDI OWSDI manual. You can download the appendix by clicking the following link:

[SDI OWSDI Appendix PDF](https://www.tdisdi.com/wp-content/uploads/files/elearning_appendices/SDI_Open_Water_Scuba_Diver_Instructor.pdf)

The SDI Instructor Trainer will review this guide in detail during the SDI OWSDI course.

The paperwork required for the OWSD program includes the SDI Student Training Folder. This folder contains the personal information, liability waiver and medical questionnaire. Should a student be under the age of eighteen (18) they must have written approval from a parent or legal guardian.

The instructor should refer to the current SDI Open Water Scuba Diver standards for a complete and up-to-date listing of requirements.

Many divers are excited, and want to learn more after they complete their open water scuba diver course. To quench that desire, SDI Open Water Scuba Diver Instructors have many options to offer them, starting with the SDI Advanced Adventure program.

### SDI Advanced Adventure Specialty

Because SDI's Advanced level requires 25 logged dives and the completion of four (4) specialties, SDI developed the Advanced Adventure program to compete with other agencies advanced diver level programs. The Advanced Adventure program requires five (5) specialty dives. Two (2) programs, navigation and deep diving, are the core-required dives. The other three (3) elective specialties can be selected from a group of specialties included in the student manual. Teaching this program is similar to teaching any specialty with the exception that each topic should only be an overview of the applicable specialty. By covering the basic academics and conducting the required skills associated with the first dive of the chosen specialty, students can get a better understanding of what to expect should they choose to complete the full specialty course. One (1) dive from each of the specialties may be applied towards the full specialty certification.

The support materials for this program include the student manual, instructor guide and a PowerPoint® presentation. Normal SDI paperwork including the waiver and medical release are required and must be retained in the student training folder.

Upon completion of the program the diver receives an SDI Advanced Adventure card. If the diver wishes to continue on and receive their SDI Advanced Open Water Scuba Diver rating they can receive credit for one (1) specialty towards the four (4) required for the SDI Advanced Open Water Scuba Diver rating.

### Teaching Specialty Courses

Divers who wish to take specialties or the SDI Rescue Diver course are obviously interested in continuing their diving education. Initially, they may only be interested in a specific specialty; however, while taking the specialty course, they may quickly learn the value and benefit of completing additional specialty training.

During the assistant instructor program the SDI Specialties that an SDI Assistant Instructor can teach were discussed. In contrast to the limited number of specialties the assistant instructor can teach, an SDI OWSDI can become qualified to teach any and all of the specialties that SDI offers. In fact, if there is a specialty SDI does not offer, SDI Instructors have the option to submit a Unique Specialty outline for approval.

There are several specialties within the SDI system that an SDI OWSDI may become qualified to teach. These specialties include:

| Advanced Buoyancy           	| Underwater Navigation 	| Equipment Specialist              	|
|-----------------------------	|-----------------------	|-----------------------------------	|
| Boat                        	| Underwater Video      	| Ice Diver                         	|
| Computer Nitrox             	| Solo Diver            	| Night and Low Visibility          	|
| Diver Propulsion Vehicle    	| Drift                 	| Search and Recovery               	|
| Dry Suit                    	| Deep                  	| Underwater Hunter and Collector   	|
| Full Face Mask              	| Altitude              	| Underwater Photographer           	|
| Marine Ecosystems Awareness 	|                       	| Wreck                             	|
| Research                    	|                       	| Visual Inspection Procedure (VIP) 	|
| Shore/Beach Diver           	|                       	|                                   	|

SDI Instructors have several options available in order to become qualified to teach these specialties.

**Option One**: Complete the specialty class with an SDI Instructor Trainer for that specialty and purchase the appropriate instructor materials. During the course, the instructor trainer will review: all of the materials available for the specialty; how to use those materials; how to conduct a typical specialty course; and what paperwork must be completed during a specialty program. The specialty instructor candidate must provide proof of 10 logged dives in the specialty area. By choosing this option the instructor has the opportunity to learn some of the tricks of the trade from someone who has taught the specialty.

**Option Two**: This option is available for instructors who have a vast amount of experience in a specialty and do not wish to complete a specialty instructor program with an SDI Instructor Trainer. To qualify, the specialty instructor candidate must: provide documentation of experience; purchase the appropriate instructor materials; and provide proof of 25 logged dives in the specialty area.

**Option Three**: This option allows the instructor the latitude to design and write a "Unique Specialty." In other words, create a specialty that SDI does not have on the current list of approved specialties. In order to do this, the specialty instructor candidate must: provide documentation of 25 logged dives in the specialty; and write and submit a complete outline defining the academic information to be covered and all in-water skill training to be completed in pool/confined water and / or open water. Unique specialties are commonly submitted to address local diving practices or needs.

When teaching an SDI specialty program the instructor must use all support materials for the specialties that have materials available. The materials used to teach a specialty may include: a student manual, knowledge quest, instructor guide and a PowerPoint® presentation. An on-line training option is also available for some of the SDI specialty courses. The student should review and complete all of the required materials before attending the class. This allows the instructor to focus more on the students' questions and practical application. In reality, however, students do not always follow through with this preparation, so it's recommended that the instructor plan time to review the academics the student has not completed.

Requirements for participation in specialties vary. SDI has compiled the following matrix to quickly show the prerequisites, number of dives required and minimum age for the different specialties. This is only a quick reference matrix; for more detailed requirements please see the course-specific standards.

| Specialty Name                        	| Minimum Age            	| Number of Required Dives 	| Student / Instructor Ratio in Open Water 	| Pre-req. Certification or requirements                    	| Certification Card must be issued by SDI 	|

 The most current standards for specialties can be found on-line in the member's section of https://www.tdisdi.com or in the SDI Standards and Procedures manual. These standards provide information such as student to instructor ratios, depth limits for dives and minimum age for participation in the various specialties.

 As with any SDI program, there is required paperwork that must be completed for specialty training. The required paperwork consists of the SDI training folder, a waiver/release, a medical questionnaire and a parental liability release if the student is younger than 18 years of age.

The instructor can structure the specialty several different ways:

- A thorough academic review can be conducted followed by a pool session and the open water dives.
- The academic session can be designed as a review instead of in-depth lecture.
- If the specialty does not require a pool/confined water session, the open water dives can follow immediately after the academic session.
- The academic review can be conducted as a review at the open water site followed immediately by the open water dives. This option can be very beneficial to the student as it provides a more casual learning environment and allows them to apply what was just learned.

There are a few specialties that may benefit from a pool/confined water session. These include the dry suit, photography and video specialties. Even if the specialty does not require a pool/confined water session the instructor has the flexibility to conduct a pool/confined water session as a skill refresher. Students who have successfully completed the course should be rewarded with their certification card and diploma.

To process a specialty card, the instructor must register the student either on-line or by sending the appropriate paperwork to SDI Headquarters or the appropriate regional office. However, many facilities have the option to print certification cards in the store.

In order to promote specialties, everyone within the store should know when specialties are offered and have some information about them. Most specialties should be promoted during the SDI Open Water Scuba Diver course. Specialty courses should be cross promoted in conjunction with other specialty courses. A calendar indicating the dates and times of every scheduled specialty should be readily available to all staff members affiliated with a dive center. That way, everyone can promote all specialties. Remember, one of the responsibilities of every staff member is to recognize the interests of the customers and educate them on the services available to them at the dive center including courses. This will be covered in more detail in the Successfully Selling Scuba section of this manual.

A complete calendar for six months, or better yet a year, listing all specialties is a great way to inform all possible students when they can plan on signing up for and taking that specialty program they're interested in. Also, it's important to remember that most specialties can be taught in conjunction with either local diving or exotic trips.

Specialty training not only improves a diver's skills and knowledge, but also keeps them involved with diving. It gives the instructor a variety of classes he can teach so he will not get tired of teaching the same class all of the time. Additionally, specialty classes usually don't take as much time to teach, so instructors have the opportunity to make more money per hour teaching a specialty.

> Just as it's recommended for divers to continue their dive education, dive leaders are encouraged to do the same. Dive leaders who actively participate in specialty or technical training set a good example for others and are more likely to pass their enthusiasm for the sport on to their students.

### SDI Rescue Diver Course

As previously stated an SDI Open Water Scuba Diver Instructor is qualified to teach several core programs without being required to take additional training beyond that of the instructor course. The SDI Open Water Scuba Diver course, the Advanced Adventure, Rescue Diver, Divemaster and Assistant Instructor make up the core programs. Each program is fun, interesting and challenging to teach. The SDI Open Water Scuba Diver program introduces the new diver to the underwater world. The SDI Advanced Adventure course allows them to try several specialties to better decide which area(s) of diving they may wish to explore. The Rescue Diver program will provide the student insight into how to become more self-sufficient and recognize and address problem situations before a rescue is required. Should a rescue be required, the course will train them for that as well.

During the SDI Open Water Scuba Diver course some basic self-help and buddy aid skills were introduced to the students. The SDI Rescue Diver program will expand on what to look for in oneself and one's buddy to help eliminate a potential accident from occurring. Students will learn how to handle an accident should it occur and what steps should be undertaken to properly attend to a diving accident victim.

> No matter what area(s) of diving interest a student has they should all be encouraged to complete the SDI Rescue Diver program when they are eligible.
Often students have stated that the SDI Rescue Diver program was one of the most demanding yet enjoyable courses they have taken.

The SDI Rescue Diver course is a prerequisite for the SDI Master Diver (non-leadership) level as well as the SDI Divemaster (entry-level leadership) level. To begin the SDI Rescue Diver Course the student must be a minimum of 18 years of age (15 with parental approval) and either an advanced diver or an open water scuba diver with a minimum of 40 logged dives. Additionally, the rescue student must have documentation of current CPR and first aid training. Student materials for the rescue diver course include a student manual, knowledge quest manual and the diver's slates. Instructor materials consist of the instructor guide, resource CD and rescue scenario slates. The suggested hours for the rescue course are twelve (12), with a recommended minimum of eight (8) in the open water.

As with most SDI courses, the waiver / release and medical questionnaire must be completed prior to starting the course. Students under the age of eighteen (18) must have parent or legal guardian approval prior to beginning the course. Once the course is completed all paperwork must be retained in the student's SDI Student Record Folder. If this is the first course an individual has taken through the facility, a new training record folder should be completed and used for the course.

Similar to other SDI programs, the student completes the student manual and knowledge quest prior to the academic session, during which the instructor reviews the materials and answers any questions the students may have. Pool/confined water is not required but it may help to streamline the open water sessions. During the in-water training portion of the rescue course the student is introduced to buddy aid and assistance skills. They practice these skills until they are proficient in them. During the final portion of the rescue program, students are exposed to various scenarios for which they must make the appropriate decisions on handing and executing a thorough rescue. The SDI Rescue Instructor Guide and Rescue Instructor Resource CD are great resources for information about how to structure the course.

After the students have completed the rescue diver training they should be presented with a SDI Rescue Diver certification card and diploma. The card can be requested through the normal channels from SDI Headquarters or the local Regional Office.

The rescue course helps build not only the student's skills, but also helps build confidence by demonstrating to them that they have the ability to handle a rescue. As the diver continues down the path of their diving career, their rescue training will help them be more aware of potential rescue situations and be able to handle and hopefully eliminate rescue situations.

Up to this point the diver level programs an SDI OWSDI is qualified to teach have been discussed. The next levels an OWSDI is qualified to teach are the dive professional levels including SDI Divemaster and SDI Assistant Instructor. It is recommended the SDI OWSDI gain knowledge and experience teaching the diver levels before they begin teaching dive professionals. With that in mind, the SDI OWSDI needs to ensure that his knowledge and skill levels are the highest possible quality before he passes the knowledge on to or demonstrates skills to professional level candidates as discussed in the next section.

## Teaching Dive Professionals

One may think that teaching dive professionals is like teaching any other course, which to some extent is true. However, there is a lot more preparation for the dive professional programs and the instructor must employ a different mindset when presenting dive professional level information. The SDI Open Water Scuba Diver Instructor must change their information delivery from simply teaching a new skill to a diver, to teaching a dive leader how to teach and supervise divers. In this section the difference between teaching divers and dive professionals will be discussed as well as how to prepare for a professional level course, and what added liability comes with training dive professionals.

### Divers vs. Dive Professionals

When teaching a diver level course, the instructor's primary goals are to convey the information and skills to the students so they can be proficient at a given level of certification. This is accomplished through academics, in-water practice and a final in-water evaluation. The end result is that the diver has comprehended the information they learned and should be able to execute the skills long after the completion of the course. This is also true when teaching dive professionals; however, the candidates must be able to execute skills and display teaching abilities once certified.

Dive professionals must meet established prerequisites prior to enrolling in a dive leader course. In fact, dive leader candidates should already have a firm understanding of basic diving theory and application. In the professional level course, they will be taught the "why" behind the theory and application. For example, SDI Divemaster candidates have been taught buddy- and self-rescue; however, in the SDI Divemaster course they must refine those techniques, and more importantly, learn how to anticipate a problem and address it before a rescue is needed.

### Theory

One of the largest differences when teaching a dive leader candidate versus a diver is the way the academic knowledge is presented. Dive professionals must have a more in-depth understanding so they are able to answer questions asked by student divers. This is not to say that dive professionals are expected to have all the answers, but they should know where to find answers to questions that they cannot immediately answer. A dive professional must know how to convey information to student divers so as not to overwhelm them with too much information. Also, the level of information given by the dive professional should be appropriate for the level of the student diver.

> For example, an open water diver asks an assistant: "How would I plan a dive to 40m/130ft?" A good response from the assistant might be: "There are several points to consider when planning dives to those depths. I would suggest taking the SDI Deep Diver specialty which will provide you with a better understanding of how to safely and properly plan and complete a dive to that depth."

Even though the divemaster or assistant instructor may be perfectly capable of answering this question, they need to remember that this dive plan is beyond the certification level of the open water diver.

Divemasters and assistant instructors must understand what their primary responsibilities are when assisting an instructor with a course. These responsibilities may include ensuring that students' forms and training records have been properly completed and preparing the classroom and training aids. When a dive professional candidate has an understanding of how to convey their knowledge and how to assist with courses, it is time to teach them how to supervise dives and handle emergency situations.

### Supervising Dives

Once a diver has met the prerequisites and made the decision to enroll in a dive leader course, it is likely that they have already assisted in a course or at least observed supervised divers. As such, the diver should have a general idea of what is involved with managing and supervising other divers. To build on this general understanding, the instructor should review with the candidates how to deliver dive briefings and how to monitor and supervise other divers.

When presenting dive briefings, the dive leader should discuss dive site information (water temperature, visibility, etc); pertinent safety information; the expected dive profile and what the divers may see during the dive. Additional information regarding dive briefings can be found in the SDI Divemaster and Assistant Instructor Manuals and their corresponding instructor guides.

Supervision of divers from the surface is a three-step process:

1. **Checking the dive teams into the water.** During the checkout, the dive leader should verify that the dive teams have all the necessary equipment; that they have air and the valve is open; and that they have conducted their pre-entry buddy check.
1. **Monitoring the site from the surface.** While the dive is in progress the dive leader should keep an eye out for lost or panicked divers and assist divers should they surface unexpectedly.
1. **Checking the dive teams back in.** During the check-in, the dive leader should welcome the divers back; log their time out of the water, their depth and dive time; and check them back in on the dive-team roster.

Every dive professional must understand that it is their job to balance diver safety while at the same time making dives fun. However, dives do not always go as planned, accidents may happen, and it is the dive professional’s responsibility to properly manage such situations should they occur.

### Emergency Situations

A major portion of a dive professional's responsibilities includes anticipating potential problems and addressing them before they happen. Early signs of diver nervousness, which include constant chatter, abnormal silence or the inability to complete a simple task, should normally trigger a seasoned professional to approach the diver and ask if there is anything they can do to help. Conversely, someone who has never been responsible for supervising divers may not be looking for these early signs. As such, it is important to discuss with the candidates how to recognize the early signs of stress and potential ways to address them. A good method is to have the candidates observe divers at a local dive site. The group should be discreet during this exercise and try not to draw attention to themselves as this may create additional stress for the divers they are observing. The candidates should observe the individuals preparing to dive and assess their demeanor. Do the divers appear nervous and if so, what are the indicators? As a follow up to their assessment, the candidates should explain how they, as the dive leader, would handle the situation.

Another method the candidates can utilize to practice recognizing stress and potential problems would be to allow them to observe an actual course. Since they are not yet certified dive leaders, they must act solely as observers. During the course, the candidates should observe the students and take notes. This information can then be discussed at a later time.

It is almost inevitable that, at some point over their professional career, a dive leader will have to rescue a diver. Of course, the extent of the actions they take during the rescue will vary from something as simple as calming a diver down while on the surface, to recovering an unconscious diver from depth. With that, it is important that a new dive leader be informed on how to address the wide range of possibilities they may encounter. During the rescue diver course they are taught to lend assistance to a diver in distress if it will not cause them harm. As a dive professional who is responsible for a diver they have an increased level of responsibility to lend assistance. The SDI Divemaster Manual examines many different emergency situations and is a great reference for the professional candidate.

### Preparing to Teach a Professional Level Course

Teaching dive professionals requires thorough planning and follow through. Just like teaching a diver level course, there must be a schedule; the equipment and any visual aids must be ready to use; and the candidates must have their materials ahead of time so they can prepare. Before a candidate can assist with a class they must have covered and understand the applicable information. For example, as part of the assistant instructor course, a candidate is required to assist with the confined water portion of an open water scuba diver course. Before they can assist with this course, they must have already covered the academics, control techniques and what is expected of them as an assistant.

> A prudent instructor will schedule dive leader and diver courses in a manner that will allow the dive leader to have already completed the required portions of their course in order to be able to assist with the diver courses.

As previously mentioned, the instructor's primary goal when teaching a diver level course is to convey the information and skills to the students so they can be proficient to a degree that warrants certification at a given level.. As such, the dive leader accepts liability for the training or supervision of the divers. However, the liability when training dive leaders is not as readily apparent.
SDI has made available several informative [educational videos](https://www.tdisdi.com/media/products/ITI_Product_Training.html) about how to teach dive leader level programs. These videos include information on:

- How to Market Dive Leader Programs
- The Materials Needed for Dive Leader Programs
- Scheduling Dive Leader Programs
- How to Teach Dive Leader Programs
- How to Properly Use and Complete the Dive Leader Training Record

### Liability of Teaching Professionals

Just as the newly certified dive professional assumes added liability for training or supervising divers, so too does the instructor who certified them to do so. Very simply, instructors who train dive leaders assume not only the liability for the dive leader's training, but may assume some liability for any divers that dive leader may subsequently supervise or train. To help mitigate this liability the instructor must follow SDI Training Standards; use all available training materials, including liability release forms; and ensure 100% comprehension of subjects and skills by the dive professional candidate during their training. While this is clearly a very serious responsibility, it is quite easy to accomplish by following the guidelines and procedures as outlined in the SDI training and support materials. Procedures for obtaining these materials will be covered in the following sections.

### SDI Products and Procedures

Every dive professional and dive center staff member plays an important role in the future of the dive center and the health of the scuba diving industry. While the primary interest of the dive professional may be educating and creating new divers, this by itself will not support the dive center or the industry as a whole. In order to maintain a healthy business all members of the staff must take part in selling equipment, promoting classes, encouraging customers to have their equipment serviced annually and promoting dive travel. If everybody contributes to each of these facets then everybody can also enjoy a prosperous and long career in the dive industry.

The dive professional, along with the dive center, will need to interact with International Training to purchase product for the courses they offer and to register divers from entry level through dive professional levels. Anytime the dive professional or dive center has recommendations for new products or programs their comments or suggestions are welcome at ITI. The following information will help the dive professional better understand the purchasing of product and registration of students with ITI. While most dive centers will purchase product and register divers, the dive professional may be called on at some point to perform these duties.

#### How to Purchase SDI Products

There are several ways to purchase product from Scuba Diving international, Technical Diving International and Emergency Response Diving International. Which of these methods is used is a matter of personal preference or convenience. While some may enjoy speaking with a person to get a better understanding of what they are ordering, others may like ordering the product online. ITI has allowed for both of these options.

**Regional Sales Manager**: Dive centers and professional members should always feel free to contact their ITI Regional Sales Manager to place an order, ask them about on-going specials or simply discuss "what's new?" Regional sales managers are quick to pass that order on to the regional office and it will be shipped out as soon as possible. This is a great option if the business hours or time zone differs from that of the regional office the dive professional works through. It is also a good opportunity to just catch up or share ideas and observations of what is happening in the local market.

**Regional Office**: Contacting the ITI Regional Office directly is another way products can be ordered. With terrific customer service, an actual person who is happy to assist the customer will be reached on the other end of the line without going to voice mail or automated menus. If it's after hours, send the order form via fax and the order will be processed first thing the next working day.

**Online Catalogue**: Go online, create an account, log on and shop! Facilities and professional members in the North American region may purchase materials at any time 24/7 - ITI is always open with the online catalogue. Facilities and professional members outside of the North American region should contact their regional office for more information. For each product there is a product description and a list of other support materials if available. Take time and browse for materials whenever your schedule permits and finalize the order when ready. This method is safe, private, quick and efficient.

**Most products are available online.**

Associate members and non-members may make purchases of certain items by visiting their local SDI-TDI-ERDI Dive Center, calling the regional office directly or in North America, by opening up an online account through the website. Because associate members and non-members are not professional SDI/TDI/ERDI Divemasters, Assistant Instructors, Instructors or Instructor Trainers (professional members) they are restricted to purchasing certain materials. Cool clothing, stickers and certain books are available to anyone, while manuals and other instructor materials are restricted for professional members only.

Please contact the ITI Regional Office or World Headquarters with any questions or comments, or to place an order - ITI staff will be happy to assist. A list of all ITI Regional Offices is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week online at https://www.tdisdi.com.

#### Registration Procedures

Once a student has successfully completed a course, the next step is to register the diver. Perhaps one of the most exciting moments, for the diver and the instructor alike - is when a diver is handed their certification card. For the diver, there is a sense of accomplishment and for the instructor there is the satisfaction of having passed on their knowledge and experience.

In order to maintain the professional image the instructor has established, and that of SDI/TDI/ERDI, it's important to register the student's record of course completion correctly and in a timely manner so the registration form can be processed quickly and the diver's credentials returned as soon as possible.

Diver registrations may be submitted via written form, pre-paid form or using the online registration system.

When completing a written Diver Registration form (found in the appendix section of the Standards and Procedures Manual) and pre-paid form, please keep the following in mind to avoid processing delays:

- Write legibly.

To register a student online, simply log in to the members area of https://www.tdisdi.com and choose either "Have HQ Print" or "Print at Facility," which can be found under the heading "Student Registrations." The latter option (Print at Facility) is only available if your dive facility has a C-Card printer and is authorized by ITI Headquarters to print cards. With either choice, it's critical to follow the on-screen instructions to ensure proper processing.

It's important to follow the established guidelines to ensure processing is completed in a timely manner. ITI prides itself on customer service and timely turnaround on certification cards. Working together, a high level of customer service can be achieved.

As outlined above there are several times a dive professional may need to interact with ITI. Knowing the procedures and process will help streamline the transaction. Please don't hesitate to contact the local ITI Regional Sales Manager, Regional Office or ITI Headquarters if should any questions arise. They're there to help!

Before any training begins students have to be acquired. The instructor, along with every other dive professional affiliated with the dive center, has a responsibility to help the dive center acquire students to fill classes. Full classes equal active divers, which promote equipment sales and travel.
