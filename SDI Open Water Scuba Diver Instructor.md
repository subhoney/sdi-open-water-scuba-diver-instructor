# SDI Open Water Scuba Diver Instructor

## The SDI Open Water Scuba Diver Instructor: Part 1

### Introduction

The next several chapters cover a good deal of valuable background information for the OWSDI candidate including: an overview of International Training's history and philosophy; requirements for certification as an SDI OWSDI and the SDI Member's responsibilities after certification; International Training's quality assurance procedures; and finally, a description of the SDI Standards and Procedures manual and what information it contains. Having a clear understanding of these things will help the candidate understand what is expected of a well-rounded SDI Dive Professional, and in turn, what the dive professional can expect of ITI; this will help establish and promote a long and healthy business relationship.

### The History of ITI

From its humble beginning in 1994 to today, the group of training agencies Scuba Diving International (SDI), Technical Diving International (TDI), and Emergency Response Diving International (ERDI) form one of the largest diving certification agencies in the World International Training Inc (ITI). With 26 regional offices servicing more than 100 countries, the company today far exceeds the original vision the founders had when they conceived the idea on a napkin, sitting at a kitchen table in the early 1990s.

As with many companies, the original concept for the business was an outgrowth of the recognition that a niche needed to be filled. This niche was providing specialized training for what the industry now calls technical diving, and the founders did so by forming the first agency of the group, Technical Diving International, in 1994.

ITI is headquartered in Stuart, Florida, United States, with regional and local offices located in more than 28 locations around the world.

#### Technical Diving International

Technical Diving International was one of the first agencies of its kind. It’s focus was and still is on providing training materials and education for specialized diving situations ranging from Nitrox to closed circuit rebreathers, as well as for overhead environments such as caves and wrecks. TDI also provides training in the preparation of gas mixtures for dives up to 100 meters (330 feet).

During TDI’s development, there were a few key factors that separated it from its competitors and pioneered the way many people learn to dive today. For one, TDI was at the forefront of the movement that convinced the dive industry to accept technical diving activities.

In the early stages of technical diving there were many industry professionals who felt the average diver was not smart enough to handle the expanded dive planning that goes into doing a technical dive, and that technical diving was far too risky for non-professionals. These two factors were offset at TDI by an extensive education process conducted through seminars, publications, and TDI’s training materials. The average diver realized that the risk in technical diving could be brought to an acceptable level and they were indeed smart enough to conduct technical dives.

Today, the industry not only embraces technical diving, but nitrox is now the most popular specialty course taken worldwide. Another key event in TDI’s history occurred when it pioneered the use of semi closed circuit rebreathers (SCR) by recreational divers. This opened the door to allow divers to use closed circuit rebreathers (CCR) recreationally and spawned a whole new segment of the dive industry. In short, TDI ushered in an exciting breakthrough in the dive industry that many believe actually prevented the industry from further decline.

#### Scuba Diving International

In 1998 the membership of TDI could no longer be held back from the demand to create a sport diving division of TDI and thus was born Scuba Diving International (SDI). The primary reason for this expansion was that dive instructors valued dealing with an agency that listened to the instructors in the field and created programs that were, and continue to be, very profitable because they are tailored to the way today's diver wants to learn to dive.

Like TDI, SDI did a number of things that separated it from previously established training agencies. One example is that SDI was the first agency to require the use of 'Personal Dive Computers' (PDC) by all students during all phases of training. This new standard was put in place because PDCs were and are used daily by most divers to make diving safer, more enjoyable and less intimidating. Research showed that the average diver forgot how to use dive tables soon after completion of a course. This fact along with the advancement and increased reliability of dive computers meant they were considered a better alternative to dive tables. SDI recognized this and although dive tables are not required curriculum in the basic diver course, they still can be taught during any course.

Another groundbreaking step taken by SDI was the development of an e-learning platform for dive education. The idea of allowing a student to learn the academic portion of a dive course online rather than requiring additional classroom instruction was a bold yet visionary step. Currently SDI is one of only a few agencies that offer divers the opportunity to learn online.

#### Emergency Response Diving International

With the membership now happy about their options for both sport and technical dive training through SDI and TDI, they continued to ask for more specialized training in public safety diving, and thus Emergency Response Diving International (ERDI) was born in 2000. ERDI was and continues to be the only training program that is supported by a major certification agency catering exclusively to public safety diving. Throughout the years ERDI has written programs that have trained very established dive teams such as the Chicago Fire Department, numerous state police dive teams, and several federal agencies.

#### Recreational Scuba Training Council and World Recreational Scuba Training Council

In 2004, with 10 years of development into the company, the founders of SDI/TDI/ERDI decided it was time to move on and sold the company to a group of investors who quickly expanded the offerings of the company. Immediate changes included applying for and receiving acceptance into the Recreational Scuba Training Council (RSTC) and the European Underwater Federation (EUF). This acceptance was critical because it meant that SDI standards were evaluated and found to be sound and safe by its competitors. SDI passed with ease and today is actively involved in both organizations, helping maintain diver safety. Other changes came with additional staff and a commitment to embrace electronic technologies to make doing business easier for members

Although SDI/TDI/ERDI is considered to be one of the newer organizations in the industry, it is viewed as one of the most professional and progressive certification agencies. ITI’s history and its reputation as an innovator have built a strong foundation for the future. By listening to its members, building programs that are profitable and addressing scuba diving’s inherent risks in a positive way, the future is bright for the organization.

### SDI Requirements for OWSDI Certification

The SDI Open Water Scuba Diver Instructor (OWSDI) program is the next step in a professional diving career. Upon successful completion of this program, the OWSDI will be able to introduce students to the underwater world for the first time and teach all of the SDI core programs. These core programs start with the open water scuba diver and progress through the assistant instructor level. Teaching these new levels will bring more responsibility and new challenges.

The OWSDI is comprised of two parts, the Instructor Development Course (IDC) and the Instructor Evaluation Course (IEC)In order to meet the responsibilities and challenges of the IDC/IEC, it’s vital that the OWSDI candidate be prepared to begin the training process. To help ensure the candidate is prepared, an established set of prerequisites must be met to start the program. The prerequisites include:

#### Prerequisites for OWSDI Certification

In a pool or confined water setting:

- Perform, to demonstration quality, all skills listed in the SDI Open Water Scuba Diver course.
- Pool/confined water problem solving

Upon successful completion of the Open Water Scuba Diver Instructor course, the OWSDI is qualified to conduct the following: Teach all SDI core levels from Open Water Scuba Diver through Assistant Instructor, where allowed.

- Teach the SDI Computer Diver Specialty
- Teach the Advanced Adventure Specialty
- Teach approved specialties after receiving training in those specialties.

As described above, the SDI Open Water Scuba Diver Instructor must have achieved certain requirements before starting and met the final guidelines, in order to complete the OWSDI course. Once certified, the OWSDI will need to meet and maintain an established set of guidelines in order to remain an active SDI Instructors. Should an SDI member fail to meet the established guidelines for active teaching status, their status may be adjusted accordingly as defined in the following section.

### Membership Status

The status of a SDI Dive Leader, along with their qualifications, defines what they are able to do and to whom they are allowed to teach and issue certifications. SDI has established specific guidelines that must be adhered to in order for an SDI OWSDI to become and remain active status.

If a dive leader fails to meet the minimum guidelines, they will be placed on a different status, which may limit or prevent some or all of their abilities as an SDI Dive Leader until the situation is rectified.

The definition, description and abilities of each member's status within the SDI System are defined below, as well as potential reasons a dive leader would be placed on the associated status.

#### Active Teaching Status

An SDI OWSDI given the designation of active teaching status must adhere to the following criteria: their annual dues and account balances from the previous year must be paid in full, they must submit proof of current liability insurance where required by law, they must have taught or assisted in at least one SDI Open Water Scuba Diver course and have the ability to perform all leadership skills to demonstration quality. Once all criteria have been met, the SDI Open Water Scuba Diver Instructor is authorized to teach SDI courses and certify students for courses in which they are certified to do so as stipulated by the SDI Standards.

#### Probation Status

An SDI OWSDI may be placed on probation status for any of the following reasons: their account balance is older than 90 days, they have failed to meet the contractual obligations of active teaching status or they have violated teaching standards.

An OWSDI placed on probation status is authorized to teach SDI courses and to certify SDI Divers. However, further standards violations may result in an SDI Open Water Scuba Diver Instructor being moved from probation status to suspended or even expelled status.

#### Non-Teaching Status

An SDI OWSDI can be placed on non-teaching status for any of the following reasons: their account balance is older than 90 days, they have been temporarily placed on suspension or they have failed to meet the contractual obligations of active teaching status.

Should the SDI OWSDI be placed in a non-teaching status, they are not authorized to teach SDI courses or to certify SDI divers. Change of the member’s status will be provided in writing to the member from International Training’s HQ Training Department.

#### Suspended Status

An SDI OWSDI can be placed on suspended status for any of the following reasons: their account balance is older than 120 days and the SDI OWSDI has made no attempt to rectify the situation, they have failed to meet the contractual obligations of active teaching status or they have violated training standards.

An SDI OWSDI placed on suspended status is not authorized to teach SDI courses or to certify SDI divers. Further standards violations can result in an SDI Open Water Scuba Diver Instructor being moved from suspended status to expelled status. Prior to being placed in a suspended status the SDI Open Water Scuba Diver Instructor will be notified in writing

#### Expelled Status

An SDI OWSDI can be placed on expelled status for any of the following reasons: their account balance is older than 120 days and the SDI OWSDI has made no attempt to rectify the situation, they have been placed on Suspended or Probation Status on more than one occasion, they have failed to meet the contractual obligations of active teaching status, or they have violated teaching standards and have displayed conduct unbecoming a professional SDI OWSDI.

An SDI OWSDI placed on expelled status is no longer authorized to teach SDI courses or certify SDI divers. An SDI OWSDI who has been expelled is no longer considered a member of SDI.

*NOTE*: ITI reserves the right to suspend, expel or terminate the membership of any member based upon the determination that standards violations have occurred by the individual.

It is in the best interest of all parties that dive leaders remain on active status throughout their career; however, there are specific issues that arise from time to time. Should such a situation arise, the dive professional is encouraged to immediately contact SDI’s Training department so they may help solve the issue in the most efficient way possible. Remember, SDI is there to help the SDI Instructor be successful.

### Annual Dive Professional Renewal

As described in the previous section, SDI/TDI/ERDI Dive Professionals must renew their membership every year to remain active and able to conduct programs they are qualified to teach. Regardless of when a dive professional first became a member of SDI/TDI/ERDI they must renew by January 1 of each year. A reduced fee is offered if the dive professional renews prior to December 15.

To renew membership, the dive professional can visit the 'Member Services' area of the SDI/TDI/ERDI website and print the renewal form, They must complete the form and send it by fax or mail to the ITI Regional Office through which they work. Only one form must be completed and only one fee paid, even if the dive professional is a member of SDI, TDI and ERDI.

There are annual renewal requirements the member must meet to renew as an active dive professional. In addition there are renewal requirements that must be met every two years. If an individual does not meet these requirements they will be required to complete an update with a designated SDI/TDI/ERDI Headquarters Representative.

Once the renewal form is received by SDI/TDI/ERDI Headquarters the dive professional's membership will be processed. A sticker indicating the member's new expiration date will be sent. This sticker must be placed on the member's dive professional card in the appropriate location.

An online option is also available on the member services page of the SDI/TDI/ERDI website. Click on that option and follow the directions. Not only does the online option allow for a more timely renewal process but also it is eco friendly by not requiring the use of paper.

Please remember that, as mentioned before, SDI is there to help the member be successful. The SDI OWSDI should contact them if they have any questions about anything regarding the collective relationship and responsibilities. Every attempt has been made to make the renewal process easy, and in many cases, what seems to be a major issue can be solved very easily simply by talking to someone at ITI World HQ or your Regional Office.

## The SDI Open Water Scuba Diver Instructor: Part 2

### Professional Responsibilities of the OWSDI

Now that we know what it takes to become an SDI OWSDI we will discuss the SDI Code of Ethics and Conduct as well as the related professional responsibilities that reinforce the Code of Ethics. While some of the responsibilities described may seem somewhat general, they are issues often overlooked and worth discussing.

#### SDI Code of Ethics and Conduct

The following items apply to all SDI professionals:

- Sport diving is recognized as carrying a degree of risk and responsibility not normally associated with other recreational sports.
- We believe an individual should not be qualified as a SDI diver unless those empowered to qualify the person would allow them to buddy or teach their loved ones recreational diving.
- The professional always maintains their equipment and never begins a dive with defective equipment.
- The professional strives to maintain an attitude of professionalism and objectivity, and supports the concept of safety in recreational diving.
- The professional will not encourage or recruit other individuals to dive recreationally if unqualified.
- The professional will make every effort to pass on their knowledge to novice recreational divers and the diving community if requested to do so, whether through formal instruction, answering questions or via appropriate publication in books,journal and magazines.
- The professional strives to encourage and practice an awareness of conservation of the underwater environment at all times.
- The professional, by virtue of his or her voluntary membership, recognizes a responsibility and obligation to promote SDI and TDI, and support the official decisions as adopted by SDI and TDI; in fulfilling this responsibility and obligation, SDI and TDI members shall:
  - Publicly support SDI and TDI as organizations.
  - Make every effort to bring about necessary changes in a professional manner by direct contact with those fellow SDI and TDI members who are in positions of authority and responsibility.
- Every member has an obligation to report violations of SDI and/or TDI Standards and the Code of Ethics.
- Every member should strive to set an example of professional behavior and ethical conduct in all activities including, public speaking, articles and books, and various forms of Internet style discourse.
- Unwarranted critical comment and deliberate inflammatory statements of diving peers is inappropriate and undesirable.

 The professional responsibilities are more than just the knowledge and experience gained getting to this point; a dive professional is an ambassador to the community for the scuba industry. They must present themselves in a positive, professional manner especially when they are teaching students or have responsibility for a group. To maintain a professional image and meet those professional responsibilities they must adhere to the guidelines on the following pages.

### Professional Responsibilities of the Open Water Scuba Diver Instructor

#### Appearance

Wearing appropriate attire for each situation portrays a professional image. If the facility has a staff dress code, all dive professionals must follow that dress code. Many facilities require the dive professional to wear a shirt bearing the store logo while teaching. For the classroom setting, a collared shirt with slacks or casual dress shorts (no cut offs) portrays a professional image, while a T-shirt and casual shorts are more appropriate for the pool/confined water or open water. Certainly when teaching in a resort location, other attire may be appropriate. When all dive staff adhere to a predetermined appearance or dress code, it portrays a cohesive team that is organized and also instills confidence and trust in the customer. This appearance must then be followed up with adherence to other responsibilities, the next of which is punctuality.

#### Punctuality

Perhaps the most important thing a professional can do is make a good first impression. This impression starts even before the first word is spoken. The dive professional should plan to arrive at least 15 to 30 minutes before class starts depending on how much preparation must be done beforehand. The classroom should be checked to make sure all teaching aids and visual aids are available and working. All equipment that is needed for pool/confined water session must be ready and functioning properly. It is a good idea to have an extra set of equipment available should a problem arise with one in use. If the class is to end on time, it must start when it is scheduled to start. If the class starts late it will end late. Students may have made plans based on the schedule that was posted when they signed up for the class. They may have told family or babysitters when they could be expected home. Should the class get abnormally delayed time after time, they may become upset and the dive professional will quickly lose their credibility.

Remember, if everything is ready to go when the students arrive for the class, pool or open water dives, not only will everything take place on time but the student will leave with a good first impression.

#### Equipment Use

As discussed in the previous section on appearance, the dive professional and dive staff must maintain a professional image. Since scuba diving involves both above and below water interaction with the customers, it is important that the SDI OWSDI carry over that image to their underwater appearance. Dive professionals must use equipment sold by the store with which they are affiliated. This equipment should be top of the line, fairly new if not brand new and replaced every year or two. Students will look to the dive professionals as experts on equipment. They will want to emulate what they see these individuals using. The equipment must be maintained as required and any visual inspection stickers must be up to date. Old worn out equipment doesn't indicate an experienced diver, it indicates someone who doesn't care about their appearance or well-being. It may also give the impression the dive professional does not believe the newer equipment is as good as the equipment made in the past.

Keeping in mind the first impression and how that builds confidence and trust in the customer, the in-water portion of the course is where the customer needs to have 100% trust in the dive professional. This may be the first time the customer is going for a dive or they may be beginning a new aspect of diving, so having their trust is paramount; and if the SDI OWSDI's equipment is well maintained and looks new this will help establish that trust.

#### Preparedness

If the dive professional is punctual this will help them to be prepared and if they are neither of these it will be obvious to the customer. The dive professional must prepare for every course they will be conducting. This means knowing what information or skills will be covered for the upcoming lesson. They should try to anticipate questions the students may have and then answer these questions with the information that is presented. Knowing the audience will help in planning. Is the class made up of young students as well as older individuals? If so, what analogies can be used to explain an idea to both age levels so they will all understand?

Anticipate situations that may occur (play the "what if?" game) especially for in-water sessions. *Always think ahead.* Thinking ahead will allow proper planning and appropriate reaction in the event an unusual situation arises.

A good practice is to mentally prepare for the course by going through all the motions; this is better done in a place where there are no distractions. By being mentally and physically prepared the SDI OWSDI and the students will experience a better course.

#### Answering Questions

It should be clear by now, there are a lot of elements to cover in order to be prepared for a course. Another crucial element is the instructor's ability to answer questions the students may have in a prompt and confident manner. The OWSDI should be able to answer these questions by drawing from their current knowledge or experience but perhaps the best way to prepare is to read the materials the students read. When an OWSDI has an assistant instructor assisting with a course, it is the instructor's responsibility to tell the assistant when they should and when they should not answer questions asked by the students. The instructor may wish to have all questions directed to him.

> If the instructor allows the assistant instructor to answer questions, the assistant instructor must be "on the same page" as the instructor and not be contradictory with their answer.

It is the instructor's responsibly to make sure the assistant instructor knows exactly what's expected of him.

The more often courses are taught by an OWSDI the easier this process becomes but it is still a very good habit to review the text the students studied, just in case something was forgotten or the text has been updated. The OWSDI will need to learn to think on his feet as all questions asked by students may pertain to the current topic being discussed. This leads us into the need to stay current not only with materials but also certifications.

#### Staying Current with Certifications

CPR, first aid and oxygen administration are required for certification as an SDI OWSDI. It is the dive professional's responsibility to keep these certifications current; most must be renew every two years. Staying current with CPR, first aid and oxygen administration is not just a matter of adhering to standards; in the unfortunate event an accident does occur the dive professional will know what to do and how to handle the scene. CPR and first aid are an evolving and ever changing science and it is a prudent dive professional that stays abreast of the changes.

Divers Continuing to LearnBeing prepared with the latest techniques and the basic equipment needed for CPR and first aid will not only help alleviate some of the stress associated with a diving accident, it will also produce a more positive outcome for the victim.

#### Continuing to Learn

Just like any other facet of life there is always more to learn, and no matter how long a dive professional has been involved with diving, they still haven't learned everything there is to know about the sport. Information is constantly changing. By continuing to expand their knowledge they will stay informed of these new ideas and will demonstrate to others that continuing education is needed at all levels. There are many avenues to continuing education from simply auditing a course taught by someone else to enrolling in a course to gain a certification that is not currently held. The simple moral here is: keep the mind open to new ideas, knowledge and techniques; they can all come in handy when a new situation is faced. The experience gained as an instructor will help tremendously when moving through the higher professional levels.

### Advancing Through the Professional Levels

SDI has many certification levels in-line with and above the OWSDI, each building on the previous and expanding the abilities of the dive professional. The following is a list of the certifications that can be obtained.

#### Specialty and TDI Instructor

An SDI OWSDI is the professional primarily responsible for training and certifying sport divers. After successful completion of both the SDI Instructor Development Course and the Instructor Evaluation Course, the SDI Instructor may independently conduct all core diver and leadership courses from SDI Open Water Scuba Diver through Assistant Instructor, as well as the SDI Advanced Adventure specialty. An SDI Instructor must be separately qualified and approved for each additional specialty diver course they wish to offer.

TDI Pro CardA TDI Instructor is the professional primarily responsible for training and certifying technical divers. Naturally, certification as an SDI Instructor (or equivalent) is a prerequisite, as well as certification as a technical diver at the appropriate level. After successfully completing a technical instructor course for each technical level, the TDI Instructor may conduct technical diver and technical divemaster programs at that level.

#### Course Director

SDI Course Director is an advanced instructor rating within the SDI curriculum. An SDI Course Director at this level may independently conduct the SDI Instructor Development Course (but not the Instructor Evaluation Course). The Course Director may also qualify SDI Instructors and SDI Assistant Instructors to teach approved SDI Specialties. The prerequisites for SDI Course Director include documented teaching experience in a wide range of SDI Diver and Dive Leadership programs.

It should be noted that there is not a 'Course Director' rating in the TDI curriculum.

#### Instructor Trainer

'Instructor Trainer' is the highest leadership level in the curriculum of SDI, TDI and ERDI. As this title implies, SDI, TDI and ERDI Instructor Trainers are responsible for training, evaluating, and certifying SDI, TDI and ERDI Instructors, as well as SDI Course Directors. Prerequisites for SDI, TDI or ERDI Instructor Trainer include significant and extensive experience as an instructor. SDI has a single Instructor Trainer rating (with the exception of CPR, VIP and Solo ratings), while TDI has an Instructor Trainer rating at each technical level.

These levels of training are what lie ahead for the OWSDI who chooses to advance. Each level provides the ability to pass on more experience and enthusiasm to those divers wanting to learn more. By achieving the higher levels of certification, the dive professional will be able to lead their customers on a journey of exploration and excitement.

To recap, paying attention to one's appearance; being punctual; using well maintained equipment sold by the facility they work for; being very well prepared; answering students' questions correctly; staying current with certifications; and continuing to learn and better oneself are goals that all members should always be certain they accomplish. SDI members who are remiss in any of these areas may end up with quality assurance inquiries and risk losing their active status, or worse - potential expulsion.

International Training takes quality assurance very seriously. As previously discussed, members are direct representatives of International Training. As such, members are expected to act professionally and maintain that professionalism throughout their career with International Training. Quality assurance is tested in several different ways, and specific guidelines have been established for responding to quality assurance concerns. The following section describes the quality assurance procedures and action steps.

### Quality Assurance

As a professional member of a self-policing organization it is important to understand how the quality of training and the materials used in training are monitored. This section discusses how SDI does this and how feedback from those surveys and other annual administrative tasks can affect a member's status.

All quality assurance matters are handled at SDI/TDI/ERDI World Headquarters by the Training Department. This is to ensure that ITI Regional Offices and Sales Managers remain neutral. The information gleaned during the QA process is used to improve the materials and standards as well as return positive feedback to the dive professionals providing quality training.

#### General Quality Assurance (QA) Procedures

Quality assurance survey letters, more commonly known as QA Letters, are sent out to students who were recently certified by members in good standing. These letters are sent with a self-addressed, return postage paid envelope or electronically via e-mail course survey form to solicit information about the course the student just completed. The questions in the letters might ask about the materials used for the course, the maximum depth achieved during the course, and other information that will help the ITI Training Department understand the student's experience during the course. SDI wants this information so that it can maintain the quality of instruction and ensure that proper training materials were used. In addition to the letters, SDI occasionally receives unsolicited emails and phone calls from students. The feedback from these QA letters, emails or phone calls can be negative or positive and either way the member's file is updated.

Now that we have discussed the potential certifications that lie ahead, various member statuses and quality assurance procedures, it is important to know where to find all this information along with course specific standards. In the next section we will cover how to navigate through the SDI Standards and Procedures manual and where to locate the answers to most questions that arise during or before training.

### Using The SDI Standards and Procedures Manual

The SDI Standards and Procedures Manual is intended to be a guide to providing complete and enjoyable training to divers for the courses the OWSDI is qualified to teach. The SDI Standards and Procedures include not only standards for courses OWSDIs can teach but for all courses SDI/TDI/ERDI Instructors can teach. The OWSDI should reference the SDI Standards and Procedures to achieve consistency and quality. They outline the vital "core knowledge" that each student needs to master to achieve SDI certification. Finally, but no less important, the manual is intended to help effectively deliver the skills and knowledge students will actually need.

The SDI Standards and Procedures Manual is meant to be a "living manual" - updated on a regular basis, it is meant to grow and change throughout the OWSDI's career. From time to time member updates will be received; the OWSDI should be sure to incorporate these updates promptly so that their manual is always up to date.

#### How to Use the SDI Standards and Procedures Manual

The SDI Standards and Procedures Manual has intentionally been kept brief but concise. The manual consists of several parts, which are:

1. Introduction
1. Diver Standards
1. Diver Specialties
1. Leadership Standards
1. Appendix

Each part of the SDI Standards and Procedures Manual is designed to have the same look and flow. Parts 2 and 3 have a general course standard followed by the specific standards for each course. The general standards apply to all standards within that section. The course specific standards are listed in a logical order and follow the normal progression of training. When clarification is needed for a specific course, refer to the general standard at the beginning of that part first, then refer to the course specific standard. If the intent of the standard is still not clear, call or email the Training Department of SDI World Headquarters.

Each of these parts also contains the information needed in order to meet minimum standards. Minimum standards ensure proficiency at a given level and stipulate that the course content can be no less than what is required by the standard. The standard for the specific course being taught should be reviewed prior to teaching that particular course and should be reviewed again before completion to ensure the standard was met. If the instructor adheres to the standards, uses the course materials combined with their experience and knowledge they will produce a well-rounded and proficient diver.

All forms necessary to complete the administrative tasks associated with conducting a course will be found in Part Five (5) Appendix.

#### Part 1, Introduction Summary

- The Need for Standardized Instruction
  - Explains SDI/TDI/ERDI's progressive approach to consistency and excellence in instruction
- The Role of a Dive Professional
  - Emphasizes the important role the SDI Open Water Scuba Diver Instructor plays in the SDI/TDI/ERDI family
- Risk Management
  - Directs the dive professional to further information to protect them against a problem that could consume their career; of course, they always want to be the best OWSDI possible
- Tips to Becoming a Great Instructor
  - Tips that offer information to help them be a better teacher and a respected professional in dive instruction
- How to Conduct an SDI/TDI/ERDI Scuba Course
  - Covers the general approach to scheduling a scuba course and enrolling students: focuses on the logistics and details (medical and legal) of scheduling training sessions, organizing students, collecting class fees and motivating students to attend all of the course sessions

#### Part 2, Diver Standards Summary

Part Two (2) contains standards for the core SDI training programs including Snorkeling, Scuba Discovery Program, Inactive Diver Program as well as the Advanced Diver Development and Master Diver certifications. Some of these programs the OWSDI may have the ability to teach. When developing a path for a diver wanting to continue their education, this is the part to refer to.

#### Part 3, Specialties Summary

Part Three (3) has all the course specific specialty standards offered by SDI. The SDI OWSDI can teach a number of these specialties (once certified for each specific level). When working with a diver to determine their interests in diving, the OWSDI can refer to this section to inform them of the prerequisites for the courses and what the courses will entail. As noted earlier, this is also where the OWSDI would review what is required during a course prior to teaching it.

#### Part 4, Leadership Standards Summary

SDI’s Leadership Course standards can be found in Part Four (4) of the Standards and Procedures Manual. After successful completion of the SDI OWSDI course the next step can be mapped out. The OWSDI may wish to gain additional specialty instructor ratings or become a TDI Instructor and this section will make clear what will be expected.

#### Part 5, Appendix Summary

All forms necessary for completing administrative tasks can be found in this part, from student registration forms to the proper form to use when reporting an incident/accident. Part Five (5) also contains all of the forms that are required at the beginning of a course such as the general liability release form and the medical history form.

All of the various parts of the SDI Instructor manual can be found in the member section of our website https://www.tdisdi.com as well as on the Standards and Procedures CD and the printed version of the SDI Standards and Procedures. SDI's Training Department routinely updates these standards and provides member updates quarterly during the year. At the beginning of each year all standards are updated on the website and it is the responsibility of the dive professional to ensure these updates are noted in their SDI Instructor Manual.

### Chapter 1 and 2 Summary

In the first two sections the history and philosophy of ITI, the parent company of Scuba Diving International (SDI), as well as an overview of what to expect during the SDI Open Water Scuba Diver Instructor course have been provided. The SDI Standards and Procedures Manual was reviewed, covering where to find the standards for courses that the OWSDI can teach and how to maintain an active teaching status. This chapter will serve as a reference point as the course progresses and information is needed to prepare for academic or in-water presentations, or to follow along while assisting with a course.

## Dive Leader Risk Management: Part 1

### Inherent Risks in Scuba Diving

At some point in time, almost every experienced diver has told a family member or interested friend that diving is a safe sport. As a professional dive leader, it is a mistake to make that kind of statement to anyone, especially someone just entering the sport as a student diver. It simply is not an accurate statement. “Safe” literally means “without risk”. In fact, few things in life are absolutely safe. Diving, like many other adventure sports, definitely has some inherent risks.

The particular risks associated with diving are detailed in the Diving Physiology chapter of this manual. Among other issues, these risks include decompression sickness and barotraumas, marine-life injuries, physical exertion with increased demands upon the cardio-respiratory system, and the possibility of drowning.

Risk management refers to the various efforts and procedures intended to minimize the inherent risks of scuba diving.

> From the perspective of the diver, these inherent risks can be minimized through appropriate prerequisite training for all participants, followed by accurate application of the student's knowledge and skills during all subsequent diving activities.

Nevertheless, despite these precautions, the possibility of injury still exists. Thus there is a clear mandate for all participants to thoroughly understand and accept these risks. Furthermore, in today's litigious society, whenever any injury occurs there also is the distinct possibility of a lawsuit. Accordingly, from the perspective of the dive leader and dive facility, effective risk management further includes appropriate measures and strategies to mitigate the consequences of a participant's injury.

### Anatomy of a Lawsuit

A civil lawsuit generally consists of two parties: the plaintiff, who files the suit seeking compensation for damages; and the defendant (or defendants), whom the plaintiff alleges is responsible for those damages. In an injury case the plaintiff is normally the individual who actually suffered the injury, though in the case of a fatal injury it also can be the family or estate of the deceased. In order to be successful in the lawsuit, the plaintiff must demonstrate four elements, as outlined below; and normally, to be successful, each of these elements needs to be established merely by a preponderance of the evidence (which is often interpreted to mean that 51% of the evidence is in favor of the plaintiff).

1. The plaintiff must be able to show damages, either financial or physical, or both.
1. The plaintiff must be able to show that the defendant (or defendants) had a duty to provide training or supervision in an atmosphere of reasonable safety.
1. The plaintiff must be able to show that, by acts of commission or omission, the defendant (or defendants) breached that duty.
1. The plaintiff must be able to show that his damages are the direct result of negligent performance by the defendant (or defendants).

In addition to actual damages, some jurisdictions also allow the plaintiff to pursue punitive damages, which are intended to further “punish” the defendant (or defendants) for deliberately injurious actions or other behavior deemed to be unusually egregious in nature.

It is an unfortunate fact that in the legal system within the USA, almost anyone can be sued for anything. The above elements need not be proven in order to file suit; instead, these elements only need to be alleged. Once a suit is filed, both the plaintiff and defendant (or defendants) are entitled to "discovery," which is a detailed process whereby each gathers evidence through formal demands for information and documents, and also through depositions (examinations under oath) of the involved parties and other witnesses. This discovery process is completed prior to trial, and the relevant information, documents, and testimony obtained during the discovery process may be introduced as evidence at trial.

As a matter of routine in the United States, when first filing suit the plaintiff normally names as a defendant every conceivable party who may be involved in any way, either directly or indirectly, in this matter. It might include the dive leader who was supervising diving activities when the plaintiff's injury occurred. It might include the dive facility that rented or last serviced the plaintiff's equipment. It may also include the instructor or dive center who conducted some diver training program for the plaintiff several years prior to the incident. In some cases a defendant may also file a counter-suit against the plaintiff, or against one or more co-defendants. Eventually, as the discovery process continues, some of these defendants may be dismissed from the suit; however, prior to reaching this point, it is likely that each defendant will have already incurred significant legal expenses related to their own defense.

Though the above comments relate primarily to the legal system in the USA, it is important to note that those dive professionals and dive facilities located outside the USA are not necessarily immune from such lawsuits. The courts in the United States generally extend tremendous latitude to US-based plaintiffs. Further, a plaintiff will often be able to establish a US "presence" for a foreign dive instructor or dive facility by identifying their use of a US-based sales agent or representative, or by simply demonstrating that they directly or indirectly offer their services to USA-based clientele.

### Defensive Teaching and Supervising

In any civil lawsuit, ultimately the actions of the dive instructor (as a defendant) will be judged against those of a hypothetical "reasonably prudent" professional, that is, did this individual perform his duties and fulfill his responsibilities in a manner consistent with that which is expected of a competent and capable dive professional?

The dive leader's best defense in any lawsuit is that he acted in full compliance with established protocols. These protocols are detailed in the SDI and TDI Standards and Procedures Manuals. The prudent professional will ensure that every training program is conducted according to standards, that every required topic is appropriately addressed, and that each student becomes proficient in all required skills.

> The prudent professional will exercise appropriate judgment and discretion. For example, the SDI and TDI standards specify maximum student-to-instructor ratios for every training program. It is important to recognize that these are maximums, under ideal conditions. Whenever conditions are less than ideal, these ratios should be reduced.

In addition, the prudent professional will never allow an individual under his charge to engage in activities for which that individual is not qualified, nor allow an individual under his charge to dive with malfunctioning or inadequate equipment.

While supervising students or certified divers, the prudent professional will expect the unexpected. Though the dive leader may exercise great effort and care in presenting information during a dive briefing, he should never assume that everything will go exactly as planned. The dive leader must recognize that, sooner or later, a student or diver may suddenly divert into some behavior that is exactly opposite of what has been briefed. The prudent professional will anticipate the various contingencies that might occur, and will formulate a plan to quickly and appropriately respond.

### Student Training Records

To defend against any later allegations of negligent or inadequate training, it is vitally important to thoroughly document each student's training activities.

The SDI and TDI Student Training Record folders are specially designed to document a student's successful completion of all academic, confined water and open water sessions, as well as all written tests and skills performance. The folder itself includes the medical statement and liability release forms (each of these forms will be addressed in more detail later). Additional documentation that should be inserted into this folder includes the student's completed Knowledge Quest / Scuba IQ Review exercises, written exams, and clearance by a medical professional (if needed).

As a training program progresses, each student's training records should be appropriately updated following each session. Whenever a student encounters some initial difficulty in mastering a skill or academic concept, the appropriate review and remediation also should be documented to demonstrate that in fact the shortcoming was addressed and that the student subsequently mastered this skill or concept.

Naturally, the training records should identify the instructor who conducted each session. It also will be helpful to note other dive leaders who were involved in the training. As an additional precautionary measure, a copy of the class roster also may be added to the folder, listing all students participating in the program, in the event that someday they may be called upon as witnesses to verify the adequacy of the training activities.

All training records should be preserved for a period of seven years. At some dive facilities it is the responsibility of the individual instructor who conducted the training to maintain these records. In other cases it will be the dive facility itself that maintains these records.

### Medical Statement

Diving is a physically demanding activity and, as such, it clearly requires a certain level of health and fitness; lacking appropriate health and fitness, the individual potentially will be placed at increased risk.

Both SDI and TDI have standard medical statement forms that each participant in all SDI and TDI training programs are required to complete. The medical statement is basically a screening tool, to ensure that an individual possesses the prerequisite level of general health and fitness to participate in diving. This form must be completed in its entirety (with no questions left blank), then signed and dated by the student; the medical statement for a minor also must be signed and dated by that student's parent or legal guardian. If a student answers "yes" to any question on this form, it does not necessarily preclude him or her from participation; however, with any "yes" answer the student will be required to obtain written clearance from a medical professional prior to participating in any in-water training activities. It also should be noted that if the student in question happens to be a physician, that student cannot provide his own medical clearance but instead must obtain written clearance from another medical professional.

The instructor conducting the program should review the medical statement with the students and appropriately address any particular issues or concerns that might arise.

> The instructor, however, should never coach a student regarding his answers to any of the medical questions, and never create any hint of suggestion that a student should falsely answer "no" to any question on this form.

Students always must be encouraged to answer these questions honestly and accurately, since concealing any applicable medical condition might expose that student to unnecessary risk.

Any "yes" answer on the medical statement requires evaluation by a qualified medical professional, to determine whether an individual possesses the appropriate level of general health and fitness to participate in diving. The instructor, as a layman, clearly lacks the medical qualifications to make this type of evaluation and to authoritatively clear an individual for diving. Despite the fact that a medical condition might appear minor and inconsequential, in no case should the instructor intentionally overlook any "yes" answer on the medical statement and allow that student to participate in in-water activities without medical clearance; doing so can easily lead to a claim of negligence if any injury subsequently occurs. In fact, this requirement for medical clearance, when indicated, is one of the provisions itemized in every standard liability insurance policy within the dive industry, and failure to adhere to this requirement may well void the insurance coverage for both the dive professional and the dive facility.

On occasion, the situation may arise where there is some reason to question a student's health and fitness for diving, even though that student has answered "no" to each question on the medical statement. It might involve something as obvious as a large surgical scar over the center of a student's chest, or something less tangible such as significant overexertion while performing a relatively benign physical task. Whenever any such question arises, the dive leader should address the issue with the student and if any concern lingers the dive leader should request medical clearance prior to further participation. At the same time, even with clearance by a medical professional, the ultimate decision for accepting a student into any training program rests with the instructor.

As a matter of routine, most instructors, assistant instructors, and dive facilities have the students complete their medical statement forms at the beginning of each course.

> It is important to recognize that on occasion, especially in the case of entry-level divers enrolled in an Open Water Scuba Diver course, there can be some disappointment and possible resentment when an individual first learns that he will need medical clearance only after they arrive for the initial training session.

To avoid this situation, conscientious dive leaders and dive facilities will make the medical statement available to each student ahead of time, the student might be provided with a photocopy of the medical statement at the time of enrollment in the course, or may be instructed to carefully review a copy of the medical statement, which has been posted on the dive facility's website. When medical clearance is required, the student also should be provided with the appropriate SDI or TDI form for the physician's use.

SDI and TDI Standards require each participant to complete a medical statement for all training programs, but do not require a medical statement for participation in other non-training activities. It must be noted, however, that local regulations can vary, and more-restrictive local regulations will supersede the SDI and TDI Standards. For example, in some jurisdictions it may be required that every student obtains medical clearance prior to any in-water training activities, and in other areas a medical statement might be required even for non-training activities.

### Liability Releases

The liability release is effectively a legal contract between the participant and the dive leader and/or dive facility, within which the participant acknowledges and accepts the inherent risks of scuba diving and also agrees to hold the dive leader and/or dive facility harmless if injury should occur. In some cases a properly executed liability release will provide sufficient basis for dismissal of a lawsuit. In other cases the liability release will serve to mitigate damages.

SDI and TDI each have standard liability release forms that apply to each of their respective diver training programs; there also is a supplemental liability release form for the SDI Solo Diver course, and additional SDI liability release forms for non-training activities including guided dives and boat dives.

In each training program the instructor conducting the program should review the applicable liability release with the students and appropriately address any particular issues or concerns that might arise. Each individual must complete the form in its entirety (with no lines left blank), and under no circumstances should the dive leader allow any of the pre-printed text to be modified in any manner. Each paragraph on the form must be initialed, the form must be signed and dated by the participant, and the form for any minor must also be signed and dated by that student's parent or legal guardian; finally the form should be signed and dated by a third-party witness (such as another student).

Similarly, in non-training activities the dive leader supervising the activities should review the applicable liability release with the participants and address any issues or concerns. Again, this form should be completed in its entirety, each paragraph should be initialed by the participant, and the form should be signed, dated, and witnessed.

In order for the liability release to be deemed valid, most jurisdictions require that the participant be allowed sufficient time to reflect on its contents. In addition, some jurisdictions also stipulate that the participant be given an opportunity to discuss this document with other family members (who might be impacted by the release) and perhaps to consult with their own legal counsel (when they feel that such is warranted). It might well be argued that duress exists when an individual is asked to sign a liability release at the very last moment, after the class already has started or after the dive boat already has left the dock, especially if there is any suggestion of peer pressure or financial forfeiture associated with a participant's decision to sign or not sign that release. Clearly, any perception of duress might well invalidate the document.

As a matter of routine most instructors, assistant instructors and dive facilities have the students complete their liability release forms at the beginning of each course. However, to avoid any perception of duress, conscientious dive leaders and dive facilities also make the liability release available to each student ahead of time, the student might be provided with a photocopy of the liability release at the time of enrollment in the course, or they may be instructed to carefully review a copy of the liability release, which has been posted on the dive facility's website.

As the students are completing these forms the dive leader should carefully explain that if they have any reservations about participating, they may withdraw without any loss of face and with a full refund.

### Liability Insurance for Dive Leaders

Affordable liability insurance for dive leaders, as well as dive centers and dive boats, is available through SDI and TDI. Dive leaders operating in most geographic locations are required to have liability insurance; in some locations it is optional but still highly recommended. As outlined above, even if a dive leader has apparently done nothing wrong, he still can be named as a defendant in a lawsuit, perhaps based solely upon the fact that at some point in time that dive leader has crossed paths with the plaintiff.

In the event that the dive leader is named as a defendant, the liability insurance will provide legal representation and cover the cost of defense.

> In the event that the lawsuit results in a judgment against the dive leader, the liability insurance will cover the monetary award. Of course each liability policy specifies the maximum dollar amount of coverage, though increased levels of coverage also are available as an option under the individual policies offered through SDI and TDI.

Currently four types of individual liability insurance policies are available through SDI and TDI. The first is intended for dive leaders operating in the USA, Mexico and the Caribbean. The second is for those in Canada. The third is for those in Australia. The fourth is for other locations but is intended only for those dive leaders who do not interact with citizens of the USA. In each area, coverage is provided according to the dive leader's professional certification, SDI Instructor, SDI Assistant Instructor, or SDI Divemaster. Coverage also is available for those dive leaders who are no longer active in the training or supervision of divers. As you might expect, the cost varies according to the dive leader's professional certification and current activities.

The standard liability insurance policies available through SDI and TDI cover only activities at the sport diver level. Additional coverage is available by endorsement (currently at no additional charge) for TDI Technical Instructors and TDI Technical Divemasters, to cover activities at the technical diver level. The same liability insurance available through SDI and TDI also can be extended (again, currently at no additional charge for technical activities) to cover any activities conducted under the auspices of another approved diver training organization.

The standard liability insurance policies available through SDI and TDI do not provide coverage when the dive leader's personally owned equipment is rented or loaned to a diver under his charge. Such coverage is available as an option (at an additional charge). Lacking such coverage, the dive leader should recognize that he should never rent or loan personal equipment to a student diver or supervised certified diver. Instead, when the dive leader desires to have back-up equipment on hand during diving activities, it should be equipment from the dive facility's rental inventory (the dive facility normally has insurance coverage for any equipment provided to customers).

As noted, insurance coverage is also available through SDI and TDI for dive centers and dive boats. In some cases, coverage under these policies can also be extended to individual dive leaders. It is important to note, however, that such coverage only applies to those diving activities that are official functions of that particular dive center or dive boat. This coverage will not apply to any activities conducted independently by the dive leader, or to any duties the dive leader performs for another dive center or dive boat.

### In the Event of a Dive Accident

Whenever any dive-related accident or injury occurs, there is the possibility of a lawsuit at a later date. It might happen when a supervised certified diver panics at depth, and bolts towards the surface while holding his breath. It might involve a student who accidentally drops a weight belt on his foot. It might even arise from an incident in which the dive leader initially had no involvement, but to which the dive leader responded and rendered assistance.

The primary concern in any incident is to care for the victim. Next, the victim's equipment should be secured; in the event of a serious incident, the local authorities may want to take custody of the equipment for further examination. Finally, the dive leader should begin to gather all relevant information, using the applicable SDI or TDI Accident/Incident Report form as a guide.

Naturally, the dive leader should be sympathetic to the victim and his family or friends. At no time should the dive leader make any comments to the victim, his family and friends, or to the authorities regarding anyone's potential liability. This is no place for opinion or speculation. All information that is reported should be completely factual in nature and should be limited only to those circumstances the dive leader actually observed first-hand. The dive leader should always politely decline any requests by the news media for information regarding the incident.

As soon as possible after the incident, the dive leader should fax the completed accident/incident report to SDI/TDI Headquarters or your regional office. If the incident occurred during training, copies of the student's medical statement, liability release and all training records should be forwarded with the report. If the incident occurred during some other supervised non-training activity, copies of the diver's liability release and any other available information should be forwarded with the report.

If the dive leader has insurance coverage through SDI and TDI, then SDI/TDI Headquarters will forward the report and related documentation to the insurance company. In some cases, on behalf of the insurance company, SDI/TDI Headquarters may initiate its own investigation of the incident. Of course, the dive leader is obliged to respond immediately to any request or further inquiry by SDI/TDI Headquarters.

Without doubt, the dive leader is also obliged to cooperate with any investigation conducted by the local authorities. On occasion, the authorities may request a written report from the dive leader; whenever possible, the dive leader should submit the very same accident/incident report to the authorities as was submitted to SDI/TDI Headquarters.

> In general the dive leader should try to avoid the creation of multiple reports, as even a minor variance between the reports may later prove to be problematic at trial.

If by chance the incident occurred during a training program that was conducted under the auspices of another diver training organization, then the appropriate reporting procedures should be followed as specified by that other training organization. Similarly, if the dive leader has his insurance coverage elsewhere, then the appropriate reporting procedures should also be followed as specified by that other insurance company. As is the case with reports submitted to the authorities, as noted above, the dive leader should try to avoid the creation of multiple reports, and whenever possible the same report should be submitted to the other training organization and/or other insurance company as was submitted to ITI Headquarters.

## Dive Leader Risk Management: Part 2

### Emergency Procedures

An accident is the least desired situation a dive professional ever wants to face. Odds are though, the longer a dive professional is actively involved with diving the greater the chance he will experience an accident. It may be a small matter, such as a cut or bruise, or as catastrophic as a fatality. It just can’t be helped. What the dive professional can and must do then is try to prevent accidents and be prepared if an accident occurs.

It is important for the dive professional to have an emergency management plan for each dive location he plans to use. This emergency management should include:

Contact numbers for local Emergency Medical Services (EMS), police or sheriff department, Coast Guard and medical facility.
Diver’s Alert Network (DAN) emergency and non-emergency numbers.
Check list of items available at the site such as telephone or radio, oxygen available, first aid kit and a copy of the appropriate incident report form.
It is recommended an incident report be completed any time medical attention is sought or a recommendation made for the diver to seek medical attention. The best precaution to take is to fill out a report for any incident/accident that takes place.

> Should an accident occur, all attention should be immediately focused on the individual involved in the accident.

If they are missing, try to determine where and when the individual was last seen. Next, decide who is qualified to help with a search. Choosing the people to search for a missing diver means making sure they are qualified, willing and that by putting them back in the water you do not jeopardize their safety. Find willing and able divers with the least amount of residual nitrogen in their bodies. Never jeopardize individuals needlessly. It may be better to wait until more qualified help arrives before starting a search. The most qualified individual on the site, which is most likely the dive professional, should take charge as soon as he finds out a diver is missing or has had an accident. If the individual involved is from the dive professional's group of divers then the responsibility to take charge falls to that dive professional.

The individual in charge should direct the management plan upon being made aware of the situation. He should assign someone to:

- Contact Emergency Medical Services
- Control the scene
- Take notes as to what happens and when
- Interview witnesses and document their comments

#### Contact Emergency Medical Services

As stated previously, the individual in charge must have an accident management plan for the site he is diving. This should include the person(s) and/or entities to contact if an accident occurs. Contact may be via the phone, radio, sending a bystander or driving for help. In remote areas make sure cell phones work and have coverage, or know where the closest landline is located. Someone may have to be sent to meet EMS and bring them to the dive site if it is located away from common use areas.

#### Control the Scene

Control the scene by making sure everyone assigned a task is undertaking the task. Assign additional individuals to help if needed. A well-coordinated scene will make everything flow much easier and show preparedness on the dive professional’s part.

Once the individual is out of the water their equipment must be secured. The dive professional in charge should have an impartial third party evaluate the equipment with him and document those findings. Take photos of the equipment if a camera is available. These photos should become part of the report to the agency.

- Does the equipment appear to be working properly?
- How much air is left in the cylinder?
- Were the valves on the cylinders open and how many turns did it take to turn them off?
- Do the gauges appear to be functioning properly?
- Is any required item missing?

Once this review is finished, both the dive professional and the third party participant should sign and date the document. Turn the air off (don’t forget to count the turns) to prevent the remaining air from leaking out and making it appear the diver may have run out of air thereby causing the accident.

#### Taking Notes

When taking notes, it is beneficial if a chronological order of events can be documented so that later when the dive professional makes his accident report he has a good idea of what happened, when it happened, and who did what. It is extremely easy to get caught up in what is happening at the moment and forget the sequence of events.

> Don't rely on memory, have someone write it down. This information comes in very handy should any legal action occur due to the accident.

Make sure this is the note taker's only task so he can be completely focused on taking notes. This individual does not need to be a diver.

#### Interviewing Witnesses

Assign someone to interview witnesses in the area as to what they observed. Make sure their comments are factual and not simply their opinions. It is recommended witnesses be interviewed separately as to not influence each other's recollection of what transpired. In the event someone needs to contact the witnesses later make sure the interviewer collects the witnesses' contact information such as:

- Name
- Address
- Phone number
- Email if possible

It is guaranteed that the more severe the accident, the more probable it is an investigator will contact the witness(es).

#### Accident Reporting

Once the accident victim has been turned over to the proper authorities and the scene has been secured, the dive professional must collect all of the information gathered by the individuals assigned to take notes and interview witnesses. This information will help the dive professional when he writes the accident report.

The dive professional should write the report as soon as realistically possible following the accident, while the event is still fresh in his memory. Because most insurance companies require notification of an accident within a certain amount of time, failure to promptly report the accident may create a coverage problem. The sooner the better is the best advice when it comes to completing and providing an accident report.

The dive professional should use the appropriate accident form and provide only the information requested. Dive professionals should not provide any information to anyone other than ITI and their insurance agent. More importantly, dive professionals should not provide any information to a third party. If a statement must be made to the local authorities, only the facts should be provided. The dive professional should be cooperative with them and avoid voicing any judments, statements or opinions regarding the accident. Talking with the media should be avoided at all costs.

Remember, anyone can be named in a lawsuit at anytime, especially those in charge of a group. In the event of an accident, it’s important that the dive professional document as many of the facts as possible to protect him and other responders.

#### CPR and First Aid

The initial certification as a dive professional requires that proof of current CPR and first aid training be submitted. After the initial certification it is the dive professional’s responsibility to maintain this training. Within the SDI/TDI system an individual has the option to take the CPROX1st or the CPROX1st AED program to keep this requirement satisfied.

### Summary: Chapters 3 and 4

This section covered various aspects of risk management and how to teach defensively. If these suggestions and procedures are followed when an accident/incident occurs, the process will be less traumatic and end with a more favorable outcome. Accidents can and will happen. An OWSDI can minimize the negative outcome of those accidents with proper training, proper planning and careful organization. Being prepared for an accident will help prevent accidents.

## Diving Physics

### Introduction

In the divemaster program, diving physics and physiology were covered in great depth. Here is a brief review of the topics focusing on the most important information. The formulas used in diving and their practical application will also be reviewed. Should an OWSDI candidate have difficulties with any of this information, he should thoroughly review the SDI Divemaster materials. A formulas sheet is provided in the appendix of this manual for use.

A general understanding of physics is a key component in the overall body of knowledge that is expected of a dive professional. The laws of physics are equally applicable both above and below the water's surface. A dive leader should attempt to convey pertinent information to every student with whom he comes into contact; and that knowledge should be tailored according to the recipient's level of training. Any additional information should be reserved for that individual who expresses further interest. A dive leader can never know all there is to know about the science of diving and the theories backing that science up, but the real art is knowing when that knowledge should be shared.

### Phyisical Properties of Water

#### Density of Water

Water is approximately 800 times denser than air. Therefore the diver will experience more resistance underwater, which may lead to increased workload, breathing and air consumption, shortening available bottom time and contributing greatly to diver fatigue. This is one reason control of a diver's profile or trim and buoyancy are important skills to master.

#### Refraction of Light in Water

Light rays bend, or refract, when they pass from one medium to another of different density. The amount of bending is determined by the refractive indices of the two media. Because the structure of the human eye is adapted to sharply focus light rays entering the eye from air, when light rays enter the eye from water, the degree of refraction generally exceeds the eye's focusing range, and thus the image appears blurry. This is why a mask is used to restore focus underwater. The mask creates additional refraction as light rays pass first from the water through the tempered glass of the faceplate and into the air space within the mask, before entering the eye. Due to this refraction, objects appear about 33% larger and about 25% closer to the diver.

#### Diffraction of Light in Water

Light rays normally travel in a straight line through a medium. Any minor obstacles encountered along the way will cause the light rays to be deflected and become scattered to some extent. This scattering, or divergence, is known as diffraction. Accordingly, the seemingly contradictory situation arises where refraction continues to make nearby objects appear closer to the diver than they actually are, while at the same time diffraction makes other objects in the middle and long distance appear to be even farther away.

#### Color Loss in Water

As explained in the divemaster course, as sunlight passes through the denser medium of water, some wavelengths of light are absorbed. The longest wavelengths (red) are absorbed the quickest by water, and this occurs at a relatively shallow depth. To remember the order colors are lost the acronym ROY G BIV can be used: Red (shallowest), orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet (deepest).

#### Transmission of Sound in Water

The speed of sound depends upon the medium through which it passes, and sound tends to travel faster in denser mediums. The precise speed of sound in water depends upon pressure, temperature, and salinity, but in general sound travels about four times faster through water than air.

#### Thermal Conductivity in Water

The thermal conductivity of any substance depends upon a number of variables including its density and overall structure. Water is a far more efficient thermal conductor than air. In fact, the relative thermal conductivity factor for water is about 6.0, while for air it is only about 0.025; thus water will whisk heat away from a diver's body approximately 25 times faster than air. Depending on water temperature divers must plan to use the appropriate exposure suit for conditions.

#### Bouyancy

Archimedes of Syracuse (287-212 BC) (my man!) discovered the principle known in physics as Archimedes' Principle. This principle states: "Any object, wholly or partly immersed in a fluid, is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object."

##### How This Principle Relates to Diving

When an object is placed in water, it displaces an amount of water equal to its own volume. If the object weighs less than the displaced water the object will float and is said to be positively buoyant. Conversely, if the object weighs more than the displaced water, the object will sink, or it is negatively buoyant. If the object weighs exactly the same as the displaced water, it will neither float nor sink, and instead it will simply hover in mid-water; it is neutrally buoyant.

Divers use three items to control their own buoyancy: lead weights, a BCD (buoyancy compensator device), and lung volume. Lead weights offset the positive buoyancy of their exposure suit and personal body composition. Air can be added or removed from the BCD (buoyancy compensator device) to maintain neutral buoyancy. But to fine tune buoyancy the diver must learn how to breathe properly and fine tune buoyancy with their lungs.

##### Saltwater versus Freshwater

Seawater contains salt and this salt contributes to the water's weight. A volume of seawater weighs more than an equal volume of freshwater. A liter of seawater weighs 1.03 kilograms, while a liter of freshwater weighs 1.0 kilograms. A cubic foot of seawater weighs 64 pounds, while a cubic foot of freshwater weighs 62.4 pounds.

##### Archimedean Calculations

To determine the buoyancy of an object, the diver must have several critical pieces of information. First, they must know the weight of the object, in terms of either kilograms or pounds. Next, they need to determine the volume displaced by the object, in terms of either liters or cubic feet. Finally, they must know the specific fluid in which the object is immersed. For diving those fluids are either salt water or fresh water.

Once armed with the above pieces of information, the diver can readily calculate the buoyancy characteristics of an object by first calculating the weight of the displaced water, and then subtracting that weight from the weight of the object.

###### Buoyancy

To solve buoyancy problems, some information is required.

1. Object weight
1. Volume of water displaced by the object
1. Weight of displaced water

> Buoyancy = weightOfObject- [(cubicFeetDisplaced)(lbsPerCubicFootOfWater)]

### Boyle's Law

#### Pressure and Volume

Although Robert Boyle (1627-1692) was not the first to discover this finding he was the first to publish it and that is why it is known as Boyle's Law. This principle states that "Any change in pressure applied upon a fixed amount of gas at a constant temperature will result in a corresponding and inversely proportional change in the volume of that gas." In other words, if the pressure doubles, the volume will decrease by one-half; and if the pressure decreases by one-half, the volume will double.

Though perhaps not specifically recognized due to the state of science at that time, in practice Boyle's Law has since been extended to also encompass the density of a gas. In effect, changes in density are a sort of a by-product of the changes in pressure and volume. Gas is comprised of molecules; when confined within any container, the quantity of gas molecules remains constant. As pressure increases and volume decreases, these molecules are pushed closer together rendering the gas denser. As pressure decreases and volume increases, these molecules move farther apart rendering the gas less dense. The change in density is directly proportional to the change in pressure, and inversely proportional to the change in volume.

Below is a table many entry-level classes use to demonstrate Boyle's Law:

| Depth (sw) |        | Ambient Pressure | Volume | Density |
|------------|--------|------------------|--------|---------|
| 0 m        | 0 ft   | 1 bar/atm        | x 1    | x 1     |
| 10 m       | 33 ft  | 2 bar/atm        | x 1/2  | x 2     |
| 20 m       | 66 ft  | 3 bar/atm        | x 1/3  | x 3     |
| 30 m       | 99 ft  | 4 bar/atm        | x 1/4  | x 4     |
| 40 m       | 132 ft | 5 bar/atm        | x 1/5  | x 5     |
| 50 m       | 165 ft | 6 bar/atm        | x 1/6  | x 6     |

In reviewing the above table it is important to understand that, in all cases, the pressure of the gas inside a flexible container will be equal to the ambient pressure exerted upon the exterior of that container.

#### How this Principal Relates to Diving

The tissues of the human body are primarily liquid, and liquid is non-compressible; thus much of the body is unaffected by pressure. Within the body there are two significant air spaces: the lungs and the interconnected middle ears and nasal sinuses. In addition, a third air space is artificially created over the face and eyes by the diver's mask. These three air spaces are impacted by the pressure-related changes. During descent and ascent, each of these air spaces must be equalized to the ambient pressure in order to avoid discomfort and possible injury.

The most common type of exposure protection worn by sport divers is a neoprene wetsuit. Neoprene is a closed cell foam and relatively light in weight compared to the water it displaces, and therefore neoprene is quite buoyant and is compressible. Changes will be most apparent when the diver is wearing a relatively thick wetsuit. To maintain proper buoyancy control, the diver needs to add air to the BCD during descent, and vent air from the BCD during ascent. Other pieces of equipment that are impacted by Boyle's Law are the BCD and dry suit.

When air is inhaled from the cylinder by the diver, it enters the flexible air space of the respiratory system and immediately becomes subject to the pressure-related changes associated with Boyle's Law. The issues related to the inhaled air are three-fold.

Upon inhalation the pressure of the air inside a diver's lungs will be equal to the ambient pressure. If that diver happens to ascend to a shallower depth while holding his breath, the expanding volume of air inside the lungs can result in a lung rupture.

> It should be stressed that a diver should always breathe continuously, never holding his breath.

The second issue with air inhaled at depth relates to the diver's rate of air consumption. When that diver descends to 10 metres or 33 feet (where the ambient pressure is 2 bar / 2 atm), the diver will need to inhale twice as many molecules of air with each breath to fill the lungs. Therefore, the air will last only one-half as long at this depth as it would at the surface.

Air inhaled at depth becomes more dense. At 10 metres or 33 feet, the inhaled air will be twice as dense as it is at the surface, and its density further increases at deeper depths.

The denser air itself generally creates no noticeable problem for a diver within traditional sport diving depths, provided that the diver continues breathing at a normal rate. However, in the event of overexertion the diver's breathing rate will quicken and, when combined with the increased density of inhaled air, may result in turbulence as the air passes down the diver's airway towards the lungs. When turbulence occurs, the diver will likely sense some degree of difficulty in breathing. It is stressed during training that divers always should move slowly and steadily underwater, avoiding overexertion.

#### The Significance of Relative Changes

Ambient pressure increases by 1 bar for every 10 metres of depth, or by 1 atm for every 33 feet of depth, in seawater. This information seems to suggest that changes in pressure, volume, and density always are uniform over various depths, regardless of the depths involved.

The ambient pressure doubles when the diver descends from the surface to 10 metres or 33 feet (which is an actual change of only one 1 bar / 1 atm), but ambient pressure does not double again until the diver descends from 10 metres or 33 feet to a new depth of 30 metres or 99 feet (which is now an actual change of 2 bar / 2 atm).

As another example, volume increases by only 25% during an ascent from a starting depth of 40 metres or 132 feet to a new depth of 30 metres or 99 feet (which is an actual change of 1 bar / 1 atm), yet volume increases by 100% during an ascent from 10 metres or 33 feet to the surface (which also is an actual change of only 1 bar / 1 atm).

The greatest relative changes occur at shallower depths. This emphasizes the importance of a diver equalizing early during a descent. It helps explain why a new diver may have more difficulty in effectively controlling buoyancy at shallower depths and why he might unexpectedly pop to the surface. It demonstrates the need for vigilance in maintaining a slow rate of ascent throughout the entire ascent, especially as the diver nears the surface.

#### Pressure and Volume Calculations

The following abbreviations appear within the formulas in this section:

- "P" for pressure
- "V" for volume
- subscript "1" for a starting value
- subscript "2" for an ending value

*Note*: The formulas for converting depth to ambient pressure, and ambient pressure to depth, are addressed in the preceding section on pressure. They must also be in a flexible container; these formulae do not work with rigid bodies.

Boyle's Law is depicted mathematically by the following formula for both Imperial and metric measurements:

$$
(P_1)(V_1)=(P_2)(V_2)
$$

A diver's rate of air consumption directly corresponds to pressure-related changes in gas volume. If a diver knows the amount of time that a certain supply of gas will last at a given depth, he can readily calculate the time at a new depth with the following formula:

$$
min_2 = \frac{(P_1)(min_1)}{P_2}
$$

If a diver knows the amount of time that a supply of gas will last at a given depth, and he wants to determine the depth at which it will last for some specific period of time, the following formula applies:

$$
P_2= \frac{(P_1)(min_1)}{min_2}
$$

To determine the relative change in ambient pressure, such as that occurring between two different depths, the following formula may be employed:

$$
change_r=\frac{P_2}{P_1}
$$

Identifying changes in gas density actually requires no further calculation, as this change will be exactly the same as any relative change in ambient pressure; that is, if the pressure is doubled, then the density will also be doubled.

### Charles' Law and Gay-Lussac's Law

Jacques Alexandre Cesar Charles (1746-1823) studied the interrelationship of temperature and volume, and discovered the principle of physics that is now known as Charles' Law: " At a constant pressure, the volume of a gas increases or decreases by the same factor as its temperature." If the temperature goes up, then the volume also goes up, and this change is mathematically predicable.

#### Formulae for Temperature and Volume

T(up) = V(up) and T(down) = V(down)

$$
T(up)=V(up)
$$

$$
T(down)=V(down)
