### Introduction

The next several chapters cover a good deal of valuable background information for the OWSDI candidate including: an overview of International Training's history and philosophy; requirements for certification as an SDI OWSDI and the SDI Member's responsibilities after certification; International Training's quality assurance procedures; and finally, a description of the SDI Standards and Procedures manual and what information it contains. Having a clear understanding of these things will help the candidate understand what is expected of a well-rounded SDI Dive Professional, and in turn, what the dive professional can expect of ITI; this will help establish and promote a long and healthy business relationship.
