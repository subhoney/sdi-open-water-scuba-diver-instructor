# SDI Open Water Scuba Diver Instructor

## The SDI Open Water Scuba Diver Instructor: Part 1

### Introduction

The next several chapters cover a good deal of valuable background information for the OWSDI candidate including: an overview of International Training's history and philosophy; requirements for certification as an SDI OWSDI and the SDI Member's responsibilities after certification; International Training's quality assurance procedures; and finally, a description of the SDI Standards and Procedures manual and what information it contains. Having a clear understanding of these things will help the candidate understand what is expected of a well-rounded SDI Dive Professional, and in turn, what the dive professional can expect of ITI; this will help establish and promote a long and healthy business relationship.

### The History of ITI

From its humble beginning in 1994 to today, the group of training agencies Scuba Diving International (SDI), Technical Diving International (TDI), and Emergency Response Diving International (ERDI) form one of the largest diving certification agencies in the World International Training Inc (ITI). With 26 regional offices servicing more than 100 countries, the company today far exceeds the original vision the founders had when they conceived the idea on a napkin, sitting at a kitchen table in the early 1990s.

As with many companies, the original concept for the business was an outgrowth of the recognition that a niche needed to be filled. This niche was providing specialized training for what the industry now calls technical diving, and the founders did so by forming the first agency of the group, Technical Diving International, in 1994.

ITI is headquartered in Stuart, Florida, United States, with regional and local offices located in more than 28 locations around the world.

#### Technical Diving International

Technical Diving International was one of the first agencies of its kind. It’s focus was and still is on providing training materials and education for specialized diving situations ranging from Nitrox to closed circuit rebreathers, as well as for overhead environments such as caves and wrecks. TDI also provides training in the preparation of gas mixtures for dives up to 100 meters (330 feet).

During TDI’s development, there were a few key factors that separated it from its competitors and pioneered the way many people learn to dive today. For one, TDI was at the forefront of the movement that convinced the dive industry to accept technical diving activities.

In the early stages of technical diving there were many industry professionals who felt the average diver was not smart enough to handle the expanded dive planning that goes into doing a technical dive, and that technical diving was far too risky for non-professionals. These two factors were offset at TDI by an extensive education process conducted through seminars, publications, and TDI’s training materials. The average diver realized that the risk in technical diving could be brought to an acceptable level and they were indeed smart enough to conduct technical dives.

Today, the industry not only embraces technical diving, but nitrox is now the most popular specialty course taken worldwide. Another key event in TDI’s history occurred when it pioneered the use of semi closed circuit rebreathers (SCR) by recreational divers. This opened the door to allow divers to use closed circuit rebreathers (CCR) recreationally and spawned a whole new segment of the dive industry. In short, TDI ushered in an exciting breakthrough in the dive industry that many believe actually prevented the industry from further decline.

#### Scuba Diving International

In 1998 the membership of TDI could no longer be held back from the demand to create a sport diving division of TDI and thus was born Scuba Diving International (SDI). The primary reason for this expansion was that dive instructors valued dealing with an agency that listened to the instructors in the field and created programs that were, and continue to be, very profitable because they are tailored to the way today's diver wants to learn to dive.

Like TDI, SDI did a number of things that separated it from previously established training agencies. One example is that SDI was the first agency to require the use of 'Personal Dive Computers' (PDC) by all students during all phases of training. This new standard was put in place because PDCs were and are used daily by most divers to make diving safer, more enjoyable and less intimidating. Research showed that the average diver forgot how to use dive tables soon after completion of a course. This fact along with the advancement and increased reliability of dive computers meant they were considered a better alternative to dive tables. SDI recognized this and although dive tables are not required curriculum in the basic diver course, they still can be taught during any course.

Another groundbreaking step taken by SDI was the development of an e-learning platform for dive education. The idea of allowing a student to learn the academic portion of a dive course online rather than requiring additional classroom instruction was a bold yet visionary step. Currently SDI is one of only a few agencies that offer divers the opportunity to learn online.

#### Emergency Response Diving International

With the membership now happy about their options for both sport and technical dive training through SDI and TDI, they continued to ask for more specialized training in public safety diving, and thus Emergency Response Diving International (ERDI) was born in 2000. ERDI was and continues to be the only training program that is supported by a major certification agency catering exclusively to public safety diving. Throughout the years ERDI has written programs that have trained very established dive teams such as the Chicago Fire Department, numerous state police dive teams, and several federal agencies.

#### Recreational Scuba Training Council and World Recreational Scuba Training Council

In 2004, with 10 years of development into the company, the founders of SDI/TDI/ERDI decided it was time to move on and sold the company to a group of investors who quickly expanded the offerings of the company. Immediate changes included applying for and receiving acceptance into the Recreational Scuba Training Council (RSTC) and the European Underwater Federation (EUF). This acceptance was critical because it meant that SDI standards were evaluated and found to be sound and safe by its competitors. SDI passed with ease and today is actively involved in both organizations, helping maintain diver safety. Other changes came with additional staff and a commitment to embrace electronic technologies to make doing business easier for members

Although SDI/TDI/ERDI is considered to be one of the newer organizations in the industry, it is viewed as one of the most professional and progressive certification agencies. ITI’s history and its reputation as an innovator have built a strong foundation for the future. By listening to its members, building programs that are profitable and addressing scuba diving’s inherent risks in a positive way, the future is bright for the organization.

### SDI Requirements for OWSDI Certification

The SDI Open Water Scuba Diver Instructor (OWSDI) program is the next step in a professional diving career. Upon successful completion of this program, the OWSDI will be able to introduce students to the underwater world for the first time and teach all of the SDI core programs. These core programs start with the open water scuba diver and progress through the assistant instructor level. Teaching these new levels will bring more responsibility and new challenges.

The OWSDI is comprised of two parts, the Instructor Development Course (IDC) and the Instructor Evaluation Course (IEC)In order to meet the responsibilities and challenges of the IDC/IEC, it’s vital that the OWSDI candidate be prepared to begin the training process. To help ensure the candidate is prepared, an established set of prerequisites must be met to start the program. The prerequisites include:

#### Prerequisites for OWSDI Certification

- Pool/confined water problem solving

Upon successful completion of the Open Water Scuba Diver Instructor course, the OWSDI is qualified to conduct the following: Teach all SDI core levels from Open Water Scuba Diver through Assistant Instructor, where allowed.

- Teach the SDI Computer Diver Specialty
- Teach the Advanced Adventure Specialty
- Teach approved specialties after receiving training in those specialties.

As described above, the SDI Open Water Scuba Diver Instructor must have achieved certain requirements before starting and met the final guidelines, in order to complete the OWSDI course. Once certified, the OWSDI will need to meet and maintain an established set of guidelines in order to remain an active SDI Instructors. Should an SDI member fail to meet the established guidelines for active teaching status, their status may be adjusted accordingly as defined in the following section.

### Membership Status

The status of a SDI Dive Leader, along with their qualifications, defines what they are able to do and to whom they are allowed to teach and issue certifications. SDI has established specific guidelines that must be adhered to in order for an SDI OWSDI to become and remain active status.

If a dive leader fails to meet the minimum guidelines, they will be placed on a different status, which may limit or prevent some or all of their abilities as an SDI Dive Leader until the situation is rectified.

The definition, description and abilities of each member's status within the SDI System are defined below, as well as potential reasons a dive leader would be placed on the associated status.

#### Active Teaching Status

An SDI OWSDI given the designation of active teaching status must adhere to the following criteria: their annual dues and account balances from the previous year must be paid in full, they must submit proof of current liability insurance where required by law, they must have taught or assisted in at least one SDI Open Water Scuba Diver course and have the ability to perform all leadership skills to demonstration quality. Once all criteria have been met, the SDI Open Water Scuba Diver Instructor is authorized to teach SDI courses and certify students for courses in which they are certified to do so as stipulated by the SDI Standards.

#### Probation Status

An SDI OWSDI may be placed on probation status for any of the following reasons: their account balance is older than 90 days, they have failed to meet the contractual obligations of active teaching status or they have violated teaching standards.

An OWSDI placed on probation status is authorized to teach SDI courses and to certify SDI Divers. However, further standards violations may result in an SDI Open Water Scuba Diver Instructor being moved from probation status to suspended or even expelled status.

#### Non-Teaching Status

An SDI OWSDI can be placed on non-teaching status for any of the following reasons: their account balance is older than 90 days, they have been temporarily placed on suspension or they have failed to meet the contractual obligations of active teaching status.

Should the SDI OWSDI be placed in a non-teaching status, they are not authorized to teach SDI courses or to certify SDI divers. Change of the member’s status will be provided in writing to the member from International Training’s HQ Training Department.

#### Suspended Status

An SDI OWSDI can be placed on suspended status for any of the following reasons: their account balance is older than 120 days and the SDI OWSDI has made no attempt to rectify the situation, they have failed to meet the contractual obligations of active teaching status or they have violated training standards.

An SDI OWSDI placed on suspended status is not authorized to teach SDI courses or to certify SDI divers. Further standards violations can result in an SDI Open Water Scuba Diver Instructor being moved from suspended status to expelled status. Prior to being placed in a suspended status the SDI Open Water Scuba Diver Instructor will be notified in writing

#### Expelled Status

An SDI OWSDI can be placed on expelled status for any of the following reasons: their account balance is older than 120 days and the SDI OWSDI has made no attempt to rectify the situation, they have been placed on Suspended or Probation Status on more than one occasion, they have failed to meet the contractual obligations of active teaching status, or they have violated teaching standards and have displayed conduct unbecoming a professional SDI OWSDI.

An SDI OWSDI placed on expelled status is no longer authorized to teach SDI courses or certify SDI divers. An SDI OWSDI who has been expelled is no longer considered a member of SDI.

*NOTE*: ITI reserves the right to suspend, expel or terminate the membership of any member based upon the determination that standards violations have occurred by the individual.

It is in the best interest of all parties that dive leaders remain on active status throughout their career; however, there are specific issues that arise from time to time. Should such a situation arise, the dive professional is encouraged to immediately contact SDI’s Training department so they may help solve the issue in the most efficient way possible. Remember, SDI is there to help the SDI Instructor be successful.

### Annual Dive Professional Renewal

As described in the previous section, SDI/TDI/ERDI Dive Professionals must renew their membership every year to remain active and able to conduct programs they are qualified to teach. Regardless of when a dive professional first became a member of SDI/TDI/ERDI they must renew by January 1 of each year. A reduced fee is offered if the dive professional renews prior to December 15.

To renew membership, the dive professional can visit the 'Member Services' area of the SDI/TDI/ERDI website and print the renewal form, They must complete the form and send it by fax or mail to the ITI Regional Office through which they work. Only one form must be completed and only one fee paid, even if the dive professional is a member of SDI, TDI and ERDI.

There are annual renewal requirements the member must meet to renew as an active dive professional. In addition there are renewal requirements that must be met every two years. If an individual does not meet these requirements they will be required to complete an update with a designated SDI/TDI/ERDI Headquarters Representative.

Once the renewal form is received by SDI/TDI/ERDI Headquarters the dive professional's membership will be processed. A sticker indicating the member's new expiration date will be sent. This sticker must be placed on the member's dive professional card in the appropriate location.

An online option is also available on the member services page of the SDI/TDI/ERDI website. Click on that option and follow the directions. Not only does the online option allow for a more timely renewal process but also it is eco friendly by not requiring the use of paper.

Please remember that, as mentioned before, SDI is there to help the member be successful. The SDI OWSDI should contact them if they have any questions about anything regarding the collective relationship and responsibilities. Every attempt has been made to make the renewal process easy, and in many cases, what seems to be a major issue can be solved very easily simply by talking to someone at ITI World HQ or your Regional Office.

## The SDI Open Water Scuba Diver Instructor: Part 2

### Professional Responsibilities of the OWSDI

Now that we know what it takes to become an SDI OWSDI we will discuss the SDI Code of Ethics and Conduct as well as the related professional responsibilities that reinforce the Code of Ethics. While some of the responsibilities described may seem somewhat general, they are issues often overlooked and worth discussing.

#### SDI Code of Ethics and Conduct

The following items apply to all SDI professionals:

- Sport diving is recognized as carrying a degree of risk and responsibility not normally associated with other recreational sports.
- We believe an individual should not be qualified as a SDI diver unless those empowered to qualify the person would allow them to buddy or teach their loved ones recreational diving.
- The professional always maintains their equipment and never begins a dive with defective equipment.
- The professional strives to maintain an attitude of professionalism and objectivity, and supports the concept of safety in recreational diving.
- The professional will not encourage or recruit other individuals to dive recreationally if unqualified.
- The professional will make every effort to pass on their knowledge to novice recreational divers and the diving community if requested to do so, whether through formal instruction, answering questions or via appropriate publication in books,journal and magazines.
- The professional strives to encourage and practice an awareness of conservation of the underwater environment at all times.
- The professional, by virtue of his or her voluntary membership, recognizes a responsibility and obligation to promote SDI and TDI, and support the official decisions as adopted by SDI and TDI; in fulfilling this responsibility and obligation, SDI and TDI members shall:
  - Publicly support SDI and TDI as organizations.
  - Make every effort to bring about necessary changes in a professional manner by direct contact with those fellow SDI and TDI members who are in positions of authority and responsibility.
- Every member has an obligation to report violations of SDI and/or TDI Standards and the Code of Ethics.
- Every member should strive to set an example of professional behavior and ethical conduct in all activities including, public speaking, articles and books, and various forms of Internet style discourse.
- Unwarranted critical comment and deliberate inflammatory statements of diving peers is inappropriate and undesirable.

 The professional responsibilities are more than just the knowledge and experience gained getting to this point; a dive professional is an ambassador to the community for the scuba industry. They must present themselves in a positive, professional manner especially when they are teaching students or have responsibility for a group. To maintain a professional image and meet those professional responsibilities they must adhere to the guidelines on the following pages.

### Professional Responsibilities of the Open Water Scuba Diver Instructor

#### Appearance

Wearing appropriate attire for each situation portrays a professional image. If the facility has a staff dress code, all dive professionals must follow that dress code. Many facilities require the dive professional to wear a shirt bearing the store logo while teaching. For the classroom setting, a collared shirt with slacks or casual dress shorts (no cut offs) portrays a professional image, while a T-shirt and casual shorts are more appropriate for the pool/confined water or open water. Certainly when teaching in a resort location, other attire may be appropriate. When all dive staff adhere to a predetermined appearance or dress code, it portrays a cohesive team that is organized and also instills confidence and trust in the customer. This appearance must then be followed up with adherence to other responsibilities, the next of which is punctuality.

#### Punctuality

Perhaps the most important thing a professional can do is make a good first impression. This impression starts even before the first word is spoken. The dive professional should plan to arrive at least 15 to 30 minutes before class starts depending on how much preparation must be done beforehand. The classroom should be checked to make sure all teaching aids and visual aids are available and working. All equipment that is needed for pool/confined water session must be ready and functioning properly. It is a good idea to have an extra set of equipment available should a problem arise with one in use. If the class is to end on time, it must start when it is scheduled to start. If the class starts late it will end late. Students may have made plans based on the schedule that was posted when they signed up for the class. They may have told family or babysitters when they could be expected home. Should the class get abnormally delayed time after time, they may become upset and the dive professional will quickly lose their credibility.

Remember, if everything is ready to go when the students arrive for the class, pool or open water dives, not only will everything take place on time but the student will leave with a good first impression.

#### Equipment Use

As discussed in the previous section on appearance, the dive professional and dive staff must maintain a professional image. Since scuba diving involves both above and below water interaction with the customers, it is important that the SDI OWSDI carry over that image to their underwater appearance. Dive professionals must use equipment sold by the store with which they are affiliated. This equipment should be top of the line, fairly new if not brand new and replaced every year or two. Students will look to the dive professionals as experts on equipment. They will want to emulate what they see these individuals using. The equipment must be maintained as required and any visual inspection stickers must be up to date. Old worn out equipment doesn't indicate an experienced diver, it indicates someone who doesn't care about their appearance or well-being. It may also give the impression the dive professional does not believe the newer equipment is as good as the equipment made in the past.

Keeping in mind the first impression and how that builds confidence and trust in the customer, the in-water portion of the course is where the customer needs to have 100% trust in the dive professional. This may be the first time the customer is going for a dive or they may be beginning a new aspect of diving, so having their trust is paramount; and if the SDI OWSDI's equipment is well maintained and looks new this will help establish that trust.

#### Preparedness

If the dive professional is punctual this will help them to be prepared and if they are neither of these it will be obvious to the customer. The dive professional must prepare for every course they will be conducting. This means knowing what information or skills will be covered for the upcoming lesson. They should try to anticipate questions the students may have and then answer these questions with the information that is presented. Knowing the audience will help in planning. Is the class made up of young students as well as older individuals? If so, what analogies can be used to explain an idea to both age levels so they will all understand?

Anticipate situations that may occur (play the "what if?" game) especially for in-water sessions. *Always think ahead.* Thinking ahead will allow proper planning and appropriate reaction in the event an unusual situation arises.

A good practice is to mentally prepare for the course by going through all the motions; this is better done in a place where there are no distractions. By being mentally and physically prepared the SDI OWSDI and the students will experience a better course.

#### Answering Questions

It should be clear by now, there are a lot of elements to cover in order to be prepared for a course. Another crucial element is the instructor's ability to answer questions the students may have in a prompt and confident manner. The OWSDI should be able to answer these questions by drawing from their current knowledge or experience but perhaps the best way to prepare is to read the materials the students read. When an OWSDI has an assistant instructor assisting with a course, it is the instructor's responsibility to tell the assistant when they should and when they should not answer questions asked by the students. The instructor may wish to have all questions directed to him.

> If the instructor allows the assistant instructor to answer questions, the assistant instructor must be "on the same page" as the instructor and not be contradictory with their answer.

It is the instructor's responsibly to make sure the assistant instructor knows exactly what's expected of him.

The more often courses are taught by an OWSDI the easier this process becomes but it is still a very good habit to review the text the students studied, just in case something was forgotten or the text has been updated. The OWSDI will need to learn to think on his feet as all questions asked by students may pertain to the current topic being discussed. This leads us into the need to stay current not only with materials but also certifications.

#### Staying Current with Certifications

CPR, first aid and oxygen administration are required for certification as an SDI OWSDI. It is the dive professional's responsibility to keep these certifications current; most must be renew every two years. Staying current with CPR, first aid and oxygen administration is not just a matter of adhering to standards; in the unfortunate event an accident does occur the dive professional will know what to do and how to handle the scene. CPR and first aid are an evolving and ever changing science and it is a prudent dive professional that stays abreast of the changes.

Divers Continuing to LearnBeing prepared with the latest techniques and the basic equipment needed for CPR and first aid will not only help alleviate some of the stress associated with a diving accident, it will also produce a more positive outcome for the victim.

#### Continuing to Learn

Just like any other facet of life there is always more to learn, and no matter how long a dive professional has been involved with diving, they still haven't learned everything there is to know about the sport. Information is constantly changing. By continuing to expand their knowledge they will stay informed of these new ideas and will demonstrate to others that continuing education is needed at all levels. There are many avenues to continuing education from simply auditing a course taught by someone else to enrolling in a course to gain a certification that is not currently held. The simple moral here is: keep the mind open to new ideas, knowledge and techniques; they can all come in handy when a new situation is faced. The experience gained as an instructor will help tremendously when moving through the higher professional levels.

### Advancing Through the Professional Levels

SDI has many certification levels in-line with and above the OWSDI, each building on the previous and expanding the abilities of the dive professional. The following is a list of the certifications that can be obtained.

#### Specialty and TDI Instructor

An SDI OWSDI is the professional primarily responsible for training and certifying sport divers. After successful completion of both the SDI Instructor Development Course and the Instructor Evaluation Course, the SDI Instructor may independently conduct all core diver and leadership courses from SDI Open Water Scuba Diver through Assistant Instructor, as well as the SDI Advanced Adventure specialty. An SDI Instructor must be separately qualified and approved for each additional specialty diver course they wish to offer.

TDI Pro CardA TDI Instructor is the professional primarily responsible for training and certifying technical divers. Naturally, certification as an SDI Instructor (or equivalent) is a prerequisite, as well as certification as a technical diver at the appropriate level. After successfully completing a technical instructor course for each technical level, the TDI Instructor may conduct technical diver and technical divemaster programs at that level.

#### Course Director

SDI Course Director is an advanced instructor rating within the SDI curriculum. An SDI Course Director at this level may independently conduct the SDI Instructor Development Course (but not the Instructor Evaluation Course). The Course Director may also qualify SDI Instructors and SDI Assistant Instructors to teach approved SDI Specialties. The prerequisites for SDI Course Director include documented teaching experience in a wide range of SDI Diver and Dive Leadership programs.

It should be noted that there is not a 'Course Director' rating in the TDI curriculum.

#### Instructor Trainer

'Instructor Trainer' is the highest leadership level in the curriculum of SDI, TDI and ERDI. As this title implies, SDI, TDI and ERDI Instructor Trainers are responsible for training, evaluating, and certifying SDI, TDI and ERDI Instructors, as well as SDI Course Directors. Prerequisites for SDI, TDI or ERDI Instructor Trainer include significant and extensive experience as an instructor. SDI has a single Instructor Trainer rating (with the exception of CPR, VIP and Solo ratings), while TDI has an Instructor Trainer rating at each technical level.

These levels of training are what lie ahead for the OWSDI who chooses to advance. Each level provides the ability to pass on more experience and enthusiasm to those divers wanting to learn more. By achieving the higher levels of certification, the dive professional will be able to lead their customers on a journey of exploration and excitement.

To recap, paying attention to one's appearance; being punctual; using well maintained equipment sold by the facility they work for; being very well prepared; answering students' questions correctly; staying current with certifications; and continuing to learn and better oneself are goals that all members should always be certain they accomplish. SDI members who are remiss in any of these areas may end up with quality assurance inquiries and risk losing their active status, or worse - potential expulsion.

International Training takes quality assurance very seriously. As previously discussed, members are direct representatives of International Training. As such, members are expected to act professionally and maintain that professionalism throughout their career with International Training. Quality assurance is tested in several different ways, and specific guidelines have been established for responding to quality assurance concerns. The following section describes the quality assurance procedures and action steps.

### Quality Assurance

As a professional member of a self-policing organization it is important to understand how the quality of training and the materials used in training are monitored. This section discusses how SDI does this and how feedback from those surveys and other annual administrative tasks can affect a member's status.

All quality assurance matters are handled at SDI/TDI/ERDI World Headquarters by the Training Department. This is to ensure that ITI Regional Offices and Sales Managers remain neutral. The information gleaned during the QA process is used to improve the materials and standards as well as return positive feedback to the dive professionals providing quality training.

#### General Quality Assurance (QA) Procedures

Quality assurance survey letters, more commonly known as QA Letters, are sent out to students who were recently certified by members in good standing. These letters are sent with a self-addressed, return postage paid envelope or electronically via e-mail course survey form to solicit information about the course the student just completed. The questions in the letters might ask about the materials used for the course, the maximum depth achieved during the course, and other information that will help the ITI Training Department understand the student's experience during the course. SDI wants this information so that it can maintain the quality of instruction and ensure that proper training materials were used. In addition to the letters, SDI occasionally receives unsolicited emails and phone calls from students. The feedback from these QA letters, emails or phone calls can be negative or positive and either way the member's file is updated.

Now that we have discussed the potential certifications that lie ahead, various member statuses and quality assurance procedures, it is important to know where to find all this information along with course specific standards. In the next section we will cover how to navigate through the SDI Standards and Procedures manual and where to locate the answers to most questions that arise during or before training.

### Using The SDI Standards and Procedures Manual

The SDI Standards and Procedures Manual is intended to be a guide to providing complete and enjoyable training to divers for the courses the OWSDI is qualified to teach. The SDI Standards and Procedures include not only standards for courses OWSDIs can teach but for all courses SDI/TDI/ERDI Instructors can teach. The OWSDI should reference the SDI Standards and Procedures to achieve consistency and quality. They outline the vital "core knowledge" that each student needs to master to achieve SDI certification. Finally, but no less important, the manual is intended to help effectively deliver the skills and knowledge students will actually need.

The SDI Standards and Procedures Manual is meant to be a "living manual" - updated on a regular basis, it is meant to grow and change throughout the OWSDI's career. From time to time member updates will be received; the OWSDI should be sure to incorporate these updates promptly so that their manual is always up to date.

#### How to Use the SDI Standards and Procedures Manual

The SDI Standards and Procedures Manual has intentionally been kept brief but concise. The manual consists of several parts, which are:

1. Introduction
1. Diver Standards
1. Diver Specialties
1. Leadership Standards
1. Appendix

Each part of the SDI Standards and Procedures Manual is designed to have the same look and flow. Parts 2 and 3 have a general course standard followed by the specific standards for each course. The general standards apply to all standards within that section. The course specific standards are listed in a logical order and follow the normal progression of training. When clarification is needed for a specific course, refer to the general standard at the beginning of that part first, then refer to the course specific standard. If the intent of the standard is still not clear, call or email the Training Department of SDI World Headquarters.

Each of these parts also contains the information needed in order to meet minimum standards. Minimum standards ensure proficiency at a given level and stipulate that the course content can be no less than what is required by the standard. The standard for the specific course being taught should be reviewed prior to teaching that particular course and should be reviewed again before completion to ensure the standard was met. If the instructor adheres to the standards, uses the course materials combined with their experience and knowledge they will produce a well-rounded and proficient diver.

All forms necessary to complete the administrative tasks associated with conducting a course will be found in Part Five (5) Appendix.
