## Introduction

SDI doesn't do printed manuals anymore. That kinda bugs me. This is a printable, searchable manual with some extra material.

## TODOs

1. Emergency plan for common dive sites
  - Contat numbers for EMS
  - DAN numbers
  - Checklist of emergency equipment at the divesite
1. Accident report form for personal use
1. Improve the "Ambient Pressure to Depth" material in the pressure section,
add references to it in the partial pressure (Dalton's Law) section
